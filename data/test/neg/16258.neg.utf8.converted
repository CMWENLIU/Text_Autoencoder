This product had a lot of great reviews, so it was a big surprise to find it really was not a good product for me.<br /><br />Although the baked goods made with this flour tasted good, with a nice flavor, it did not knead well, and refused to rise well.<br /><br />So the bread it made was good-tasting, but with terrible texture.<br /><br />I tried more than one thing to make it work, and more than one recipe. All failed, and the common element was this flour. I used it in a bread machine, and it didn't work. The dough did not come together into a ball, but remained crumbly, almost like cookie dough. Everything was right, and the recipe was a proven one. All ingredients were measured correctly, the proper yeast (fresh and in perfect condition) was used, and used correctly, but the dough would not come together well, nor would it rise well.<br /><br />My wife also tried to use it in homemade recipes, using our big stand mixer to knead the bread, but that bread also failed. Again, she used proven recipes, but with this flour, had poor results.<br /><br />Finally, we tried mixing it into better-for-bread flour that had proven its worth many times... but even 1 cup (1 cup out of 4) caused the same problems... poor cohesiveness in the dough (where usually when the best-for-bread flour is used, you get a nice velvety ball), and a low flat loaf.<br /><br />The results were consistently bad... no matter where or how (even only mixed in a little into some better flour) or how we used it our breads failed.
