I bought this thinking it would make a wonderful gift to my neighbor's young son.  Ordering was simple, and delivery was flawless.  So you can imagine the shock and awe not only on my face, but also my neighbor's 3-year-old son, when he opened the package to find a DEAD rabbit.<br /><br />When I contacted Cloverdale about this issue, I found myself on hold for hours listening to John Tesh: Live at Red Rocks.  After 3 hours on hold, I was asked to leave a message.  Wait 3 hours and leave a message??<br /><br />Suffice to say, I have not heard back from Cloverdale.  Look closely people, nowhere on the page does it say that this rabbit comes DECEASED.  To all of you looking for a fun pet, do not be deceived by Cloverdale's deception.  This rabbit is NOT alive.  It is DEAD.
