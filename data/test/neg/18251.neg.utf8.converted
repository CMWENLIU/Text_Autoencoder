My gf bought this for me not knowing what's in the basket.  First of all, instead of that frog you see in the picture, a cheap one dollar store stuffed animal came.  And, snacks they put in the basket would cost you no more than $10, even if you buy them at overpriced convenience stores.  They put some cheap looking imitation snacks that looked like Doritos, and they were from "golden flakes", a brand that i've never seen or heard.<br /><br />WORST OF ALL, I found a live COCKROACH inside the shipping box that contained this gift!!!  It was huge.  Seriously, I was going to take a picture to share customer image on amazon page, but it was just too gross.<br /><br />I feel so bad for my gf who was such a sucker to buy this crap.
