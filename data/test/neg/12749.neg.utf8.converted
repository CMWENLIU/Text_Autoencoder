So, I bought this product to help my cat take a pill. It was the chicken flavor. It seemed like a nice alternative to using pill pockets. He ate the very first pill and that was it. i tried a few more times and it was almost as if he did not even recognize the product as food. I tried to email the company about the "flavor guaruntee" and the email was returned as undeliverable.<br /><br />Bummer...<br /><br />Honestly, my best alternative to help with pills are a product called, "Lean Treats". I cut the pill into smaller pieces and break the treats in half. He likes these the best.
