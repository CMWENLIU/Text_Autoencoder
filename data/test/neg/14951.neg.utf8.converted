This is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Even upon first opening the wrapper, I was hit with an unpleasant chemical smell.  Very unappetizing.  I could barely swallow the first (and only) bite I took.  It has a heavy cinnamon overtone, which I think is an attempt to mask the terrible taste of the thing.  It is very hard, dry, and tastes like soap combined with three-week-old brown rice.  If there was a contest to make a food item that tastes the LEAST like carrot cake, this would win, hands down.<br /><br />I am so disappointed because I've tried other products by NuGo that have been really tasty.  I hope I can send this back.
