I too had the same problem with dented cans. The problem is in the material the cans are made of. When I opened one of the cans I noticed that my can opener created little dents all the way around the can when I was done. I don't believe it is Amazon's fault that the cans arrived dented.<br /><br />The dented cans wasn't my biggest dissapointment. I have been using Thai Kitchen's coconut milk. I decided to try Chaokoh since it is supposed to be so great. Comparing the two, Thai Kitchen is, in my opinion, higher quality. It is thicker, creamier, and more oily. In contrast, Chaokoh is more wattered down and seems to lack some of the coconut oil present in Thai Kitchen. The taste isn't much different but the ingredients are. Thai Kitchen has no preservatives and is basically soaked and pressed coconut meat. Chaokoh contains citric acid and sodium metabisulfite as preservatives.<br /><br />Given the choice, I'll take the cheaper, more natural, preservative free option with a better texture.<br /><br />Oh, and I've ordered at least 5 12 pack cases of Thai Kitchen coconut milk and have yet to recieve a dented can and my can opener does not dent them either.
