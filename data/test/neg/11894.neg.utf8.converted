I was HIGHLY disappointed to receive this product, all 16 ounces of it, to find out that it's not an artificial butter flavor for baking at all! It is actually SOY/SOYA OIL!!! You could use this to replace normal oil in recipes, and have that oil taste more buttery, but this is NOT NOT NOT an artificial butter flavor that you add to cookies and such in the amount of teaspoons. If your recipe calls for 2 cups of oil, you would use 2 cups of this to substitute, which would be like 2 cups (16 oz.) of oil with ~1 teaspoon of artificial butter flavor mixed in.<br /><br />The whole reason I purchased this is because we have family members with allergies, including to dairy and soy, and our local grocery stopped carrying Schillings Artificial Butter Flavor that I usually use. If this CK product were simply labeled correctly on the front of the bottle pictured or in the product description, I never would have bought it! What this product would be good for is pouring over popcorn straight from the bottle, like the stuff they use at the movie theater. It is quite the same!<br /><br />If you are looking for an actual artificial butter flavor, that you could add 1/2 teaspoon to your cookie recipe to give them a buttery flavor, as in AN ACTUAL ARTIFICIAL BUTTER FLAVOR FOR BAKING, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VM8R2">Wilton No Color Butter Flavor</a> instead. We now use the Wilton's butter flavor along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1DG4">Spectrum Naturals Organic Shortening</a> (actually 100% Palm shortening, not hydrogenated) in any baking recipes that call for butter or shortening. I contacted the company, and Wilton confirmed the ingredients were as one would expect for an actual "imitation butter flavor" to be used in any baking.<br /><br />Shame on CK for such false advertising and misleading labeling!
