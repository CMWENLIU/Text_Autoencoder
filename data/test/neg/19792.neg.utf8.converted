<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGG8D">Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle Bonsai</a> I was totally disappointed with this product! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered it, which taught me a lesson. The picture showed beautiful, purple flowers...when mine arrived, it barely had any leaves, let alone flowers! Also, the instructions that came with the "plant" said it was for outdoors, & there was nothing about that in the description. Amazon was wonderful about giving me a refund, but I think they probably had a lot of practice giving refunds for this one! I also learned not to order plants through the mail. I would not recomend this product.
