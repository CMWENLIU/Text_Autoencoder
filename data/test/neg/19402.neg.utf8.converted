I usually buy Annie's Fruit Snacks b/c they are sweetened with fruit juices - no sugar.  I decided to try these b/c they contain veggies, they were cheap, and I assumed that an apple company would sweeten their "natural" fruit snacks with juice, as well.<br /><br />However, BEFORE I purchased them, I contacted Mott's to find out the ingredients (b/c they are not included anywhere on the amazon description).  It was an odd situation b/c the response I got directed me to contact another company but assured me that this product was made with real fruit (which it is - it just contains other not necessary stuff).  The other company never responded to my request for a list of ingredients.  I'm embarrassed to say that the price suckered me in and I ended up buying 80 pouches of sugar.<br /><br />NTS, I will be returning to Annie's and will be placing my order soon b/c I'm not feeding my kid bags of refined sugar as a snack.<br /><br />What's really weird is that when the package arrived and I tried to find the list of ingredients, it was covered by a big upc label of some sort.  Like they need to hide the ingredients even after you've purchased.<br /><br />Not sure what I will do with my box of sugar.
