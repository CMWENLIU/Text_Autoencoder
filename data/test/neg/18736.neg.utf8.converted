There is another brand of organic rooibos tea offered on Amazon (Choice brand) that I previously ordered.  I gave that tea 5 stars.  Numi also offers a good rooibos.<br /><br />I decided to give Davidson's a chance since it was so cheap.  Now I understand why it's so cheap.  It is extremely weak tea.  2 bags of Davidson's is still not equal to 1 bag of Choice.  Maybe 3 or 4 bags is more like it.<br /><br />I actually ended up throwing out my most recent cup of Davidson's because I had left 2 old bags in there, along with 2 new bags (so 4 bags in total) thinking that maybe I could suck more tea out of the old bags (something I did quite often with the other brands).  But the joke was on me because what the tea ended up tasting like was the bags themselves with just a hint of tea.<br /><br />I feel that drinking this brand of rooibos tea is more like drinking plain water with just the hint of tea flavor.  I doubt I will drink the remaining 96 bags I have left but will instead use them for my tired eyes when I go to bed at night.
