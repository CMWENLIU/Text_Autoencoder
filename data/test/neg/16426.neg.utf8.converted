My wife got one of these for me as a Christmas gift.  My eyes almost popped out at the concept.  I was so excited to try it.  After the first bite I thought "hmmm... maybe it takes another bite before its goodness kicks in...".  Well, 4 bites in and I threw it away.  Don't tell my wife.  I think most of the cost of this product is in the packaging.  That is very unfortunate.  Bacon lovers: stay away.  Chocolate lovers: stay away.  You have been warned.
