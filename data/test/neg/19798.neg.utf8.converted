I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15. As of January 5, they still did not receive the card noticing them of the gift. When I called flying noodle, they gave me the brush off, saying that they could resend a notice to me (not doing me any good being 3000 miles away) or could resend them the card for a $5 fee. I told them that was unacceptable and had to actually ask for a manager to get anything straightened out. It almost doesn't matter how good the cakes or other products are if the company is unreliable.
