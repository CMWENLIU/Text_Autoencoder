I have purchased a wide variety of K-Cups of both coffee and tea, but these Twinings English Breakfast Teas are the only K-Cups that have had the foil lids unseal while the machine is running. Making any size of drink other than a small six-ounce cup results in the K-Cup overfilling and spilling out of the unsealed lid, resulting in hot water and tea leaf bits all over the inside of my Keurig - and in my tea.<br /><br />I thought this might be a manufacturing defect limited to one box, but K-Cups from two of the three boxes delivered by Amazon, as well as K-Cups from a box of the same type from the grocery store, all had this defect.<br /><br />I would not purchase the Twinings brand of K-Cups again.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/16/12: DH went to the grocery store unsupervised and bought another box. Every cup in the box still suffers from the same problem.
