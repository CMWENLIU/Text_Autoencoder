All Almonds grown in the U.S.A. are DEAD!  I found out that they are either full of pesticides and/or boiled.  I purchase Sicilian Almonds, because they don't have to be "pasteurized".Russ Bianchi is the most famous formulator in the world.  Here is THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT and certified organic:  [...], you can read about his company Adept Solutions, Inc.  His credentials include PhD Harvard, PhD Berkley and UCSF.  Here is his review of Almonds grown in the U.S.<br /><br />Illegal/medical legal POT is the number one cash crop in California, followed by almonds.<br /><br />As a matter of fact our founder and true great and good soul Ken Brailsford grew up in a part of California that had many almond orchards, where as yours truly grew up among the prune orchards (all now gone to grapes).<br /><br />California's gross production in revenue remains agricultural and mineral or petroleum output; not movie stars and silicon valley.<br /><br />I remind you the USDA (Congress - all incumbents in the US House and US Senate) LIED a few years back to EVERYONE, and ordered the "pasteurization" of the entire California Almond Crop (approximately 98 percent of the world's supply).<br /><br />There are always major problems whenever Uncle Sam (proven pimp for death merchants like Big Pharma, Genetic Modification, Tax Revenue From Tobacco, Alcohol, Guns, Ponzi Scheme Social Security, Eugenics, etc.) sticks their gluttonous claws into anything.<br /><br />In the case of almonds, there is NO "pasteurization" going on, almond growers and producers are forced to harmfully IRRADIATE the almonds (just like cancer causing scanners from TSA in airports); ripping out the nutrient values on all almond products.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, almond milk is highly heated, enzymatically dead, nonabsorbable and nutrient void, aseptic, white, fake, sugar water.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, the canary in the mine is not only dead, when it comes to what Uncle Sam has allowed to happen to food and beverage processing in America, the canary long ago disintegrated, and the mine has collapsed and been abandoned.<br /><br />Want real nutrients?<br /><br />You better consider DRINKING LIFE IN!<br /><br />~ Uncle Russ<br /><br />Almond giant Blue Diamond will break ground next month on a multi-million dollar, state-of-the-art monster almond processing facility in Turlock, California.<br /><br />Want to learn more about what we are putting into our bodies, his website is a treasure trove of empirical data.  Including 2009 Nobel prize winner for Physiology Dr. Blackburn of the UCSF.  BTW, he does NOT sell anything on his website.<br />Knowledge begets Wisdom.<br /><br />Google Sicilian Almonds and Sicilian Almond Butter--You will be glad you did!
