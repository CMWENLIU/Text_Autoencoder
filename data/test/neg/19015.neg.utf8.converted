I am a regular subscriber of this "Jack Link's" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10. I used to trust Amazon and this is the first time that I check the quantity in the box. Since the inside box is open, so someone might have taken one during the packing process because s/he loves it so much but I hate to lose one bag of my Jack Links beef jerky!!
