I bought this with such high hopes of having fresh herbs all winter (we successfully grow all kinds during the summer) and I was SO disappointed!  I followed the directions to the letter and did everything exactly as I was supposed to ... to no avail.  Only 3 of the 8 plants even grew and were available to eat and after 3 months they ALL died. Don't waste your money ... I wish I hadn't!
