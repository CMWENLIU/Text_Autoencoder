This seller should be expelled from amazon.com. This was a wedding aniversary surprise to my wife aNd was absolutley DISAPOINTING. The roses were tiny. They come in a box as do it your self kit. All the mood was ruined by this vendor. ThIngs like this damage amazon.com's reputation of screening vendors that publish in their site.<br /><br />Payed more that 100 bucks for these and the a lot worst than flowers that you buy in the street.<br /><br />DONT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR. DO NOT TROW YOUR MONEY TO THE TRASH!!!!<br /><br />Detailed prictures of the products will be uploaded for you to judge.
