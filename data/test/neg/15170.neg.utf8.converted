The product inside was leaking and the inside of the box and all the juice bags have mold growing.  The product is completely unusable.<br /><br />It also describes it as juice boxes but I received bags.  More importantly, it says Pack of 4, and I only received one, meaning I paid $19 plus shipping for 10 moldy juice bags. I have sent a request to Amazon to get a refund.
