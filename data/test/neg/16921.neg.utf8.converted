There's nothing like fresh Bassetts All Sorts - but this product did not have the freshness I was looking for in fact they were just this side of stale.  The pkg was awful - it was crammed into the smallest priority envelope and by the time it got to me half of the candy was hanging out.  Not a good experience.
