This has to be one of the worst whole coffee beans I've ordered.  I don't think it was due to coffee bean direct or that the beans were old.  I actually believe them to be pretty freshly roasted.  The coffee bean itself I think was subpar to begin with.  It was like someone took all of the beautiful aromatic notes out of the coffee and left me with an old balsam like note (Kind of like the smell of a cheap cigar).  The taste was bearable once I put some chicory in, but without it I didn't want to drink it.<br />If you want to buy 5lbs of coffee please stick with one you can trust.  A sumatra, columbian, or even costa rica blend would be better than this.
