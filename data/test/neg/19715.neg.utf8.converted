the main issue with these pods would be that there's not quite enough coffe in one pod for the advertised 8oz brew of coffee.  they expect you to make an 8 oz brew with their single pod as opposed to 2 Senseo pods, which end up having significantly more coffee to brew from than their only slight larger single pod.  the result is very watery coffee--well, almost tasteless.  to remedy this, instead of placing their single pod into the 1pod holder, place 2 pods into the 2pod holder for an 8oz brew which makes a more tolerabe coffee in terms of strength.<br /><br />the next problem is taste.  this is all preference but i find the taste decent at best.  it's lacking in flavor and body.  perhaps a bit bitter too.<br /><br />lastly, the packaging is embarrasing (if not hugely questionable).  the inidividual pods came in very scratched, generic packaging.  meanwhile all 15 pods were packaged together in not some proper javapodz logo-ed box but...a ZIPLOC bag!  (which actually would be forgiveable if the inidividual pod wrappings didn't look so worn, cheap, and almost fake.)  I was hoping to try their other flavors but now I'm highly reluctant to.<br /><br />The pods by Gourmet Cafe, another coffee pod stocked at amazon, I tried previously were quite good.  Those are good to try if you're disappointed with these Javapodz.
