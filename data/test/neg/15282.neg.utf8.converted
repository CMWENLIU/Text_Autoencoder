I love Amazon, but sometimes their pricing strategies astound and disappoint me...like with Drake's Funny Bones. If you can't figure out a way to distribute these for a reasonable price, then don't offer them.<br /><br />I love Funny Bones, and if my rating was JUST for the product, I would give them 5+ stars...but at $27/box for a 20-pack, Amazon should be arrested...it's downright robbery.
