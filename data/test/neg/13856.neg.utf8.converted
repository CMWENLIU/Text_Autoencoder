The plants grew huge, flowered, but never produced tomatoes.  We shook them like the instructions said, but zero tomatoes.  On top of that, over the last few weeks, it has gotten very loud.  Sounds like the pump is loosing a bearing or something.  We have cleaned it, but still loud.  Very disappointed.  My wife wants to toss the whole thing in the trash.
