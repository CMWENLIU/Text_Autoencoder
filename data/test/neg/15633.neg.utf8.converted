I fell for the pretty box at first, and I'm glad there is a more natural alternative to aspartame and even an alternative to Splenda. But Truvia is the most expensive stevia-derived sweetener I have found, and even though Truvia claims to be made from the sweetest part of the stevia plant, Stevia Supreme is sweeter (and cheaper).
