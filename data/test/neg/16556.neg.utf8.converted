I've been eating Chicken of the Sea chunk light tuna for years.  I preferred it over other common grocery store brands because the tuna came in good sized chunks (similar to the consistency of solid white albacore of other brands) and was generally very good quality.<br /><br />In the last several months, something has changed.  As another reviewer noted recently, what you get now is a can full of finely chopped up mush that is much darker in color and not nearly as tasty.  I thought maybe it was a fluke and I bought a bad can, but I've gone through about 10 straight cans over a 4 month period, and they've all been of the same substandard quality.  Perhaps the company started cutting corners or using inferior quality fish to improve its profits; whatever the reason, I cannot eat this trash any more and am on a search for a better tuna fish.
