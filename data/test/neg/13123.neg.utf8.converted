Take a reasonably-sized potted plant. Take two liters or so of spring water. Pour said water into potted plant. After waiting a short while, drain off the liquid that emerges from the bottom of the pot. Pour this liquid into a clear plastic bottle, and then write blk. on it. Place bottle onto shelf, and post a price tag of $2.50 for just over half a quart of it. "Spring water infused with Fulvic Acid." LOL<br /><br />"A sucker born every minute." Yup, he was right.
