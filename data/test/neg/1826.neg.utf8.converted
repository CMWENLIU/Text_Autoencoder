If you want a noodle without the guilt, well, this ain't it.  Better to limit your "real" noodle intake and enjoy it than suffer with this.  I've tried Tofu Shirataki Noodles from the local health food store which are a bit better, but nothing replaces the real thing.  These are rubbery, no flavor really, and don't digest well.  Save your shekels.
