Hello Brownie Lovers! Unfortunately I love brownies, and unfortunately I have dietary restrictions that forbid me from eating the Sugars. So unfortunately I found myself in possession of a box of Doctor Carbrite Diet Brownies. My Moms-in-Law gave them to me for Christmas. So with the whole family over, I decided to mix up a batch of these devilish delights.<br />Well, let me tell you, I don't know what Doctor would recommend the intense intestinal distress caused by these brownies. Holy Hell! Myself and my Christmas guests were utterly disgusted by the brown, methane cloud that resulted from my consumption of said brownies. I have since discovered other foods which contain Malitol (artificial sugar-izer) and carry a warning of "may cause possible intense intestinal distress". Well let me just cut to the chase for you: These brownies cause some seriously foul smelling gas. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 beacuse they DID taste pretty good goin' down. Thanks for that Dr. Carbrite, of that is your real name.
