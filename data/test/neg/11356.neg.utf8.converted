This coffee has tons of aroma when it brews, but virtually no kahlua taste.  I found the coffee roast to be bland and lacking in the complexities I love in coffee.  Granted the Keurig doesn't brew a great cup anyway, but this fell short of a decent Keurig cup of joe.  Just sipped it again; really blah.
