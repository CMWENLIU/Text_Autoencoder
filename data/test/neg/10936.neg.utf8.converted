I was very surprised to open the box and find only a letter from the USDA explaining they can't allow citrus leaves or lemongrass entry.  This is probably because I live in California where we grow citrus and don't want any imported pests (we have enough pests of our own already :-).<br /><br />Note that the post mark on this was Thailand.<br /><br />The seller should have know this and not sold to me.<br /><br />I guess it is OK if you live in some other state.
