edit - 2011-10-18<br />howdy y'all,<br /><br />the last shipment is ... not good. the slices are puffed instead of dried and they have a background taste & scent of not-quite-rotten vegetable oil.<br /><br />NOT recommended.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee<br />*****<br />howdy y'all,<br /><br />this is _exactly_ what i was looking for. the other nanner chips i have found are all candied. NOT what i need.<br /><br />very good in oatmeal [i add 'em _after_ nuking the oatmeal] or one of the plain flake cereals.<br /><br />i haven't had the "moist and chewy" problem others have mentioned.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee
