We sent a case to a couple of young people living on a tight budget -- I thought some canned protein would be a nice addition to thier pantry.  I offered to send another case and was told 'no thanks'.  They report that this product filled with small bones and cartiledge meaning there was wasted product and time wasted in cleaning it.
