Frozen food product arrived warm to the touch.  I disposed of it.  I got in touch with vendor and was told it was my fault for not requesting expedited shipping.  I asked why they even offered regular shipping if they knew that this was not a safe method of sending frozen food.  I asked for a replacement, but was told that they had a recommendation on their website about this sort of thing and, again, it was my fault for receiving product in this condition.  Ground service should not be an option and if it is, then they should make sure the product is packaged properly to withstand the travel time.  I am extrememy disappointed and will not use this vendor again.
