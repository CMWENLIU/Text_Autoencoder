My cat loves Fancy Feast catfood.  However, all five of the Fancy Feast subscriptions I signed up for have been unreliable.  Im October, I signed up for delivery every two months and received shipments only in October and December (it's now March 18, but I canceled all of my subscriptions yesterday).  What was supposed to be 48-can cases Amazon turned into 24-can cases, with one flavor being canceled entirely.  I was notified by Amazon that shipments would be sent in mi-February, but they never arrived.
