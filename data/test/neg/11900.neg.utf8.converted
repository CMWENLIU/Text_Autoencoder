I know this may seem silly, but I thought I was buying powder/dry icing colors.  These are gels, and as such, contain all kinds of junk in addition to the coloring, including high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, glycerine, and sugar.  Gels are preferable to liquid color because they don't dilute your icing or cause it to crack as badly, but powder/dry colors don't contain other ingredients so they don't spoil and aren't as bad for you!
