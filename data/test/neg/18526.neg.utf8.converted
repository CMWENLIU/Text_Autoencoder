Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.<br /><br />I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.<br /><br />The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.<br /><br />Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
