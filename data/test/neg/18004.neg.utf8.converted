I ordered this product and only received one box of the Back to Nature White Cheddar & Spirals Dinner instead of 12 boxes.  Amazon.com did charge me for the entire case though.  They tried another time to send me the correct package but again I only got one box.  They told me I could keep the two boxes for my troubles and they would cancel my order.  However, a month later they charged my credit card for the two boxes!  I had to call and have them take the charge off. This product was more trouble than it was worth.
