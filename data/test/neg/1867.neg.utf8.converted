This is the worst coconut milk ever. My wife is Thai and we had used this brand before and appreciated that it was organic and BPA free cans. However, now its made in Sri Lanka and the quality of the coconut milk is unacceptable. The packaging is completely misleading as the product looks nothing like the image on the label. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. I now have 11 cans of inedible coconut milk.
