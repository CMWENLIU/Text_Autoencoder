I bought this exact tea from Coffee Bean Direct about a year and half ago, and that tea was wonderful with fresh Jasmine aroma and really refreshing Jasmine Green Tea taste.  I just got my second order and am really disappointed, they have changed the type of tea, the color is more brown, doesn't have the fresh taste and there's hardly any Jasmine aroma.
