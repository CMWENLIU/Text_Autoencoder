These might mean well, but I found the seeds to be very bland.  NO SALT is added, which I did not realize when I bought them:( Also, you should note that they need to be refrigerated once opened. Not very convenient when taking them on trips or to the beach.  These may be good on salads , but otherwise, I found them to be less than desirable. I guess a real health food nut would like these.  I try to eat organic, all natural foods as much as I can. But, I can find much better tasting stuff than these seeds. On a positive note, sunflower seeds are among the healthiest foods you can eat.  VERY good for you. I ended up giving almost all of this shipment to the food for the poor.
