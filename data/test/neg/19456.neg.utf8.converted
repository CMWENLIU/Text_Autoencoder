This so-called Tom Kah soup only resembles the "real thing" vaguely, by the fact that it contains coconut milk.  It is thin and watery, doesn't have enough vegetables in it, and its flavor is pleasant but not distinguished.<br />It doesn't compare to the Tom Kah soup served at my local Thai restaurant, nor for that matter, to my homemade version. I will use all these cans as a  base and add white meat chicken, thinly sliced onions, more carrots, lime juice, more lemongrass, fish sauce and hot sauce - then I will have true  Tom Kah soup.  In other words, practically start from scratch. I won't buy any more of it, that's for sure!
