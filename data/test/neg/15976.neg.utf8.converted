We made this seasoning purchase based upon the item as-pictured. Unfortunately, the received seasoning is quite different from what was pictured. To explain further, Lawry's made a significant change in their taco seasoning, not for the better, a number of months ago. When they did so, they also changed the packaging of the product. We based our purchase upon the pictured seasoning, the "old" and tasty seasoning, yet what we received was the "new" and not-so-tasty seasoning, which can be purchased at any grocery store. Not worth sending back, but if what you're looking for is the good stuff, avoid this one. I finally think I'm going to try my hand at making my own taco seasoning.
