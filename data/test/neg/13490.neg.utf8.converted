I don't understand why this would be advertised on Amazon at all?  Buying from Nespresso the capsules are .57 ea. These are .97 each.  I saw this advert and trusting Amazon, clicked on it.  Plus, what is a "used" capsule?  Somehow this whole category is not worthy of Amazon with these prices and items.
