I bought this product with great expectations. But after I followed all the directions on the package, the soaking and the cooking it, it had no flavor and was so without taste that I had to ask for a refund, which Amazon comply. There is one food that I like more than any othet is mushrooms. And for me to be desapointed so much as to ask for a refund, it was pretty bad!
