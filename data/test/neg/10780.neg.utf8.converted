I used to LOVE the ZICO Coconut Water.<br />I used to buy 2 boxes monthly.<br />Until they decided to change from the Tetra-Pack to the Platic Bottles.<br /><br />For some reason, ZICO thinks its a better product, unfortunatly, the plastic leaches to the Coconut Water and changes the taste. It literally taste like plastic.<br /><br />I stopped buying ZICO and went over to O.N.E., not as tasty as the Tetra-Pack ZICO, but atleast doesnt taste like plastic!!!<br /><br />KEEP AWAY FROM ZICO, until they change it back to Tetra-Pack!<br /><br />Aparently i found out after some dabling online. Its not 100% coconut water, they changed the process where they make the coconut water out of CONCENTRATE.....honestly...concentrate??? No i am pissed off.....
