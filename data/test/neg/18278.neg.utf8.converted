I've been experimenting with sourdough starters for about 4 months now and I bought this one expecting it to be the real San Francisco deal.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I got a bread that tastes virtually the same as home-made starter. I think the trick that bakeries like Boudin have is their baking process. So If you want to mimic their bread, buy the industrial ovens they use and make your own starter.
