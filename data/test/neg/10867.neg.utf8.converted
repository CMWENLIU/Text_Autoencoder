I bought the newer 2% after enjoying the original velveeta shells since a child. The taste was horrible and after adding chili to it, only edible. Add the fact that one serving is 50% of your daily salt and I will never buy this again. Definitely not worth the price. Disliked it enought that I even tried to find a customer service number on their website with no luck.
