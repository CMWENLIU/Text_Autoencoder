Yes this is a great deal for cinnamon.. but in actuality it is technically not cinnamon.  Everything that I have read has said that cassia has similar properties and taste to cinnamon but it is NOT, in fact, cinnamon.  This is not a problem if you are using it in arts & crafts or some kind of potpourri, but when it comes to ingesting these (or even attempting to grind them with your coffee grinder- I think they will make short order of your grinder (They are very hard). They also contain a substance called coumarin in a dose high enough to cause liver damage to sensitive individuals. I'm bummed, because I was going to use them to eat/drink, but now I guess my apartment will just smell like cinnamon..everywhere..
