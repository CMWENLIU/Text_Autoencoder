I was VERY disappointed when I received these pears.  They are not peeled and the seeds are not removed.  The peels alone I could probably forgive, but many pieces have seeds and/or core, which make for difficult eating, especially for children.  Even the taste is rather bland.  They are not sweet pears at all, and are leathery texture.  Definitely not a child-friendly snack!  Now I'm stuck with fifty bucks worth of seeded dried pears, because you can't return food.  Definitely would NOT recommend!
