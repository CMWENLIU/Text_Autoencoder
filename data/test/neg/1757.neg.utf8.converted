I've cooked quite a bit with rosewater, but I'd never tried orange flower water before. I found a recipe that called for it that I wanted to try so I ordered a bottle.<br /><br />the water looked clear but when I opened it up I was greeted by a smell reminiscent of stagnant pond water. I was ready to throw it away, but my mother insisted on tasting it, in case it tasted better than it smelled.<br /><br />She spent 10 minutes over the sink spitting and gagging. Is orange flower water *supposed* to taste and smell like this? Please tell me this is a mistake. I can't imagine why anyone would want to cook with it.
