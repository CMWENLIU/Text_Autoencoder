I was making a vegan "mocha decadence" cake for my bf and I needed a bunch of chocolate covered coffee beans for the recipe. I had a hard time finding them, it seemed like everywhere I found them, from World Market to Trader Joes, they contained milk and/or butter or some other dairy product. Finally I ended up ordering some with all vegan ingredients from nutsonline, and I should have used those but I messed up and left them at my boyfriend's house with no way to get them before I made the cake and only two days to find some new ones. So, I really needed to find something on Amazon and take advantage of Amazon Prime two day shipping.<br /><br />I was really excited to find these Crackheads, even though they do contain white chocolate coated beans as well as the dark chocolate, and even though I would rather have had a half or whole pound of beans all in one bag and not packed in individual small boxes. I figured I'd just pick out the white chocolate ones if I had enough, or otherwise just try the recipe with both.<br /><br />When the Crackheads arrived in the mail, I was really disappointed because I read the ingredients and what it says here on the website doesn't match what is on the box and these are not, in fact, vegan.<br /><br />Here is the actual ingredient list...<br /><br />Dark Chocolate (sugar, chocolate liquor (processed with potassium carbonate), cocoa butter, butter oil, lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla), white chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, cream, natural flavor, soy lecithin (emulsifier), pure vanilla), fresh whole bean coffee, sugar, corn syrup, tapioca dextrin, confectioner's glaze.
