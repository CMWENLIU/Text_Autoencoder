I ordered this thinking it would come in a glass jar.  I was disappointed to see that it comes in a plastic container.  It is labeled as recycling #1 (PETE), which from what I have read can leach phthalates when left in the heat (which is was, since the package was left on the porch in the sun and who knows where it was before that).  I don't like to take my chances with chemicals leaching into a product that I want to put on my skin and in my food.  I tried to return it but surprisingly (and happily), Amazon refunded the money without requiring me to send this back. WOW!  Way to go Amazon for customer service.  I just think the description of the product should specify that it comes in a plastic container.
