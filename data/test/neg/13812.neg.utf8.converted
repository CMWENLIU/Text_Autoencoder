I know growing malt is difficult, but this is to much. Bobs red mill needs better quality control. The flour is tart with a touch of bitter. Without even a touch of sweetness to the flour, it is not a malt, as malting was developed to bring out the sugars naturally found in the 1 to 3 day old sproutlings. With this "malt" not being sweet I can only suggest the sprouts have been overgrown.<br /><br />Update: I have now received my second order (1/17/2012) of bob's red mill's malted barley flour and am very pleased. The flour is slightly sweet. On this batch they must have given the seedlings 5 hours of maturation, after soaking for sprouting, instead of immediately drying after soaking as may have been the case. Correction; in my above statment of "...can only suggest the sprouts have been overgrown.", I could have also suggested the sprouts were dryed to soon! My rating has gone up to 3 stars.
