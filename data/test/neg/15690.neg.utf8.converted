First there is no information on the label about how much curcumin is actually in the product.  How do you know how much you are getting?  Second, this has to be about the worst tasting drink I've ever had.  It is truly horrible.  If it tastes this bad, why bother putting it in a drink?  Third, all of the curcumin is on the bottom of the bottle.  It settles out quickly, if you don't keep shaking it and drink it quickly (hard when it tastes so bad) a lot of the curcumin is left on the bottom of the bottle.  I find it interesting that they say, "Specifically formulated for excellent absorption".  This is just marketing BS.  There is nothing in this product (read the ingredients) that does anything to increase the absorption of curcumin.  Curcumin typically has very low absorption, and this formulation really has nothing, and does nothing to improve it.  While I applaud the inclusion of beneficial curcumin in the drink, the execution of the Haldi drink is severely lacking.  Mystery amount of curcumin (why?), horrible taste and consistency, and the curcumin ingredient keeps coming out of the drink without constant agitation.  Much more pleasant, easier, and cheaper to just take a curcumin supplement capsule.
