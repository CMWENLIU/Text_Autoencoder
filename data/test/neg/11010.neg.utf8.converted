I bought this recently for my 2 yr old who needs to drink rice milk.  Needless to say it was a waste of money.  It took me almost 30 mins to mix it with my hand mixer to get it into a drinkable constistancy.  Otherwise it was very, very clumpy.  Then my son refused to drink it, it must be disgusting, as I had tried other brands and never had an issue before.
