We bought this for a birthday cake.  It looks really cool, and is quite easy to make.  After we baked it, we took it out of the pan, and tried to flip it over carefully right side up.  This is when it fell into pieces.  Luckily, you can fix it with icing, but it is hard to do.  An easier way to make the cake would to just buy two different colors of cake (doesn't have to be chocolate and vanilla) and just do the same thing as with the Duff cake mix.  It is a great idea, but BAD mix!  Even the cupcakes were so crumbly they didn't hold together as cake, and made a big mess.  Skip the cost, buy your own separate cake mixes!
