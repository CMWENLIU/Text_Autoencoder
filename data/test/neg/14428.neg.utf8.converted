FYI: The "Natural flavors" claimed on the container appear to be "dust" and "all-purpose flour," and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never "mix" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.
