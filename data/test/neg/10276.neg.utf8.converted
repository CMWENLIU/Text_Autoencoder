I have been using a keurig brewer for just over a year now and tried just about ever brand of k-cup/coffee that is out there and never had a problem with cups opening up....until I bought a box of Caribou Coffee decaf from Amazon.  I am about half way through my box of 24 and THREE cups have split at the top seal when brewed. I have never had this happen with any of my k cups and now 3 from one box.<br />Hopefully it was just a bad box but still felt like voicing<br /> my opinion
