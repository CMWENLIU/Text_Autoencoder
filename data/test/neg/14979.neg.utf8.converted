We use alot of olive oil in our family and have tried oils far and wide.  I received this as a gift from a groupon offer ($25 "half off") many months ago and it is good, but does not stand out.  I noticed that all of the perfect 5 star reviews pretty much only review this product and it leaves me wondering if these are true reviews or just planted to sell the product, which would not be cool... why not just let real customers review the product?  - just pointing this out!  Happy holidays to everyone out there.
