I have never seen such a sloppy and unsuitable packing job from Amazon<br /><br />or its affiliates!!! Three plants, with only base protection, which<br /><br />did not fit next to each other in the carton, were just thrown into the<br /><br />box with styrofoam flakes (popcorn) in between and on top!!! This resulted<br /><br />in up to 50% of leaves rubbing off during transit and worked their way<br /><br />to the bottom of the carton. Also the 3 leafelets were wet and sticking<br /><br />together. I returned this order.
