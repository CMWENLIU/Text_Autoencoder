This soup can best be described as edible, and nothing else. Filled with tasteless orange carrot bits, tasteless noodle bits, with none of the general good taste of plain old Campbell's Chicken Soup.<br /><br />Further, the way these are packaged by Amazon is absurd; the package does not have a hard top, so any weight coming down on these is going to come down on the soup containers themselves. The soup containers have a flimsy, flexible plastic top with will not stop anything, and in the end the weight comes down on the peel-off product seal. Result? Leaking, exploded soup everywhere.<br /><br />Mine arrived with three soup cans exploded, which I realized only after seeing soup leaking out of the still-sealed box from UPS. Even better, the soup was all over several other items that were in the same box.<br /><br />Would not buy again.
