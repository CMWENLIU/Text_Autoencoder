I don't typically eat processed foods but I was sold on their mission statement of offering convenient, healthy, delicious meals made with only natural and organic ingredients (100% Natural, No MSG, No Preservatives).  I bought several to keep at my office, unfortunately, these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.<br /><br />The first one I tried was late last year.  They were the Teriyaki Noodles and after trying to convince myself that it wasn't 'that bad', I finally tossed it after just several bites.  I refused to touch the other bowls in my desk after that experience but also didn't throw them out because it seemed like such a waste.  Today, out of hunger and laziness, I finally tried the Kung Pao Noodle Bowl.  While I did find this one to be more palatable and finished all but just a few bites, it really isn't something I could recommend to anyone.<br /><br />The Teriyaki Sauce and Noodles were just gross.  The Kung Pao Sauce was at least tasty but the Noodles were still funky.  Basically, the noodles are pre-cooked and vacumed sealed for you.  Out of their packaging, they smell like playdoh and they look weird - like soft rubber - not like a food item.  You add boiling water (or microwave them with water) to basically re-heat them, drain and add the sauce.  I love the concept but that weird playdoh smell just never disapears and I find it hard to convince my brain that I'm actually eating noodles and not some weird inorganic product.  With the Kung Pao noodles, I chose to use boiling water (over the microwave method I used the first time) and after straining the noodles I repeated the process a second time with more boiling water to better 'rinse' the noodles.  This seemed to get rid of the weird smell a bit more and the sauce was flavorful enough that it covered up most of the remaining weird noodle smell taste.<br /><br />The last one I have in my drawer is the Pad Thai flavor.  I'm in no rush to try it but of course, won't throw it out (I hate being wasteful like that) but once it's gone, I will not be purchasing any more Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls.
