The product currently advertised on Amazon is no longer made by Chatfield's.  You will not receive grain sweetened chips if that's what you are looking for!  The chips you will receive are sugar sweetened and are sickeningly sweet!  In addition, in the recipe where I used them in a chocolate/carob topping, heated and mixed with milk, they stayed gooey instead of hardening like other chocolate or carob chips I had used.
