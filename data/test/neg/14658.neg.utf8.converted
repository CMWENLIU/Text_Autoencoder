well i used this for the first time last night after dinner around 7pm. as the directions stated, i didn't brew it for long. i added hot water to the cup with the teabag but the water wasn't hot enough so i microwaved it for 30 seconds let it sit another 30 seconds and removed the teabag. i added a sweet and low and it tasted good, not like medicine at all. i was fine, laying in bed watching tv for the next 2 - 3 hours, then the cramping started. i got progressively worsening cramps from the upper part of my abdomen all the way down to the bottom of my belly, it was very painful. i started feeling very bloated like i needed to belch or... well... yea. i noticed that the cramping was at its worst when i was laying down, standing up i felt better. i got nauseous and thought i would throw up. then i had to run to the bathroom because the extreme laxative effect was kickin in. this lasted until about 2:30am and i need to get up for work in the morning. i was really miserable. in the morning i felt ok until i ate breakfast (a bowl of crispix cereal) then i felt like i needed to use the bathroom again.  doubt i will use this again but if i do i will only drink a quarter of a cup.
