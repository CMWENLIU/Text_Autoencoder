I love coffee...and I love tea, but this really left me wondering what I was drinking and why.  It isn't either one really, and didn't catch my interest as something novel and new either.<br />Unfortunately, none of my taste test victims were thrilled with it either, whether they were coffee or tea fans.  I can't recommend it.  It just didn't please our palates.
