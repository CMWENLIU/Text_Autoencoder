At the time i bought this the description said it suppose to bring 3 boxes for each sale.  I made 2 orders and literally only received only 2 boxes.  I contacted amazon and they tried to send me the item again with the appropriate amount as the description says.  Again, only 2 boxes came with the package.  I got fed up and didnt even wanna deal with it anymore.  Im giving this item a 1 star based on the false description/amount you get from ordering this item.  The cereal itself is good.
