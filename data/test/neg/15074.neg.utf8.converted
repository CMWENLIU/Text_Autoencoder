The Post Office called me today to report that they have cayenne pepper all over the floor of their building and it's coming from the box addressed to me.  Actually they called to find out what was coming out of that box!  According to Amazon website this is not a returnable item.  If that holds true, I've spent almost $18.00 on a product that I'm not getting.  Frontier Organic Red Pepper (Cayenne), Ground, 1.76-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)
