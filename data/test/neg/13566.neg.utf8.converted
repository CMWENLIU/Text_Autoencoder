First up, the dressing didn't come with it.**  Secondly, there are no English instructions.  That's no hill for those of us that would buy this item, but<br /><br />I recommend another soak beyond what's in the illustrations.  Next, it's all one big bag, so you only get one shot at it.  I'd hoped it would've been packaged in 3 or 4 serving sizes.<br /><br />The taste?  Good.  **I had to really take a wild guess at what kind of dressing to use. I made my own soy based recipe.<br /><br />Finally, don't expect the free stuff in the Amazon ad.  It wasn't there either.<br /><br />Save your money and head for your nearest Asian market.
