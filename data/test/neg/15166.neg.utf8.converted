Yep. Buyer beware. Zico is not the wonderful, tasty product it once was (when it was actual coconut water, not reconstituted standardized coconut water).<br /><br />If you like degraded flavor, this is the product for you. If you want fresh coconut water, minimally processed, seek elsewhere (ONE, VitaCoco, Amy & Brian, etc). Amazon has other options NOT from concentrate.<br /><br />If you can get the Zico in the tetra pak with the non-concentrate formula, you will be much happier. This cool bottle design, while convenient, houses nasty stuff.
