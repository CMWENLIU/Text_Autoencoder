I've tried four different flavors of the hint water, and -- when the quality is up -- it's excellent.  However I've received two batches that were off:  the pear I bought in individual bottles at the store was good; but the pack from Amazon was pretty much tasteless.  Worse, though, is that the second pack of watermelon I purchased tasted vaguely moldy or musty.  Being a procrastinator, we received our next monthly shipment before I cancelled the subscription, and I can say that the new pack is good.  However, with both the "musty" pack and the "good" pack in hand, the difference becomes even more apparent.  For example the "good" pack has a definite fruit scent when the bottle is opened; the "musty" pack has no fruit odor at all.  Checking the dates the new pack expires about a week after the "musty" pack, so I would guess that a filter got changed at the factory or something.  (Note, however, that both dates are in March of 2013; the "musty" pack is definitely not expired despite tasting like something has started growing in it.)<br /><br />So while the product is great when it's on, the quality control is decidely lacking (all three bottles I've opened from the "musty" pack are identical; I doubt they're the only 'bad' bottles from the batch).  For the price, I'm not interested in taking chances that it'll be undrinkable when it arrives.
