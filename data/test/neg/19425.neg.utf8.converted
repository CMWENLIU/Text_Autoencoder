I think these taste good but am not sure why everyone is calling them vegan.  The ingredients list dry egg whites.  To me this is not a vegan option and I'm disappointed that I ordered based on everyone's review that they were vegan.  They taste good to me, but I will not reorder and am disappointed the reviews led me in the wrong direction.<br /><br />So, I give a low review because I hope it will cause others to read the review and know this item is not vegan, as suggested and as searched.  Otherwise, if you are not vegan they taste good and I would have been happy.
