This "pasta" was really gross.  I prepared it using the package instructions soaking for 24 hours and then draining and it was really tough and had no flavor. I was expecting a fishy taste but that is not there at all. I purchased it to try a recipe that I got from a raw food online site and the whole experience was a disaster.  In my opinion, you would have to prepare this spaghetti with a really flavorfull sauce so that it can mask the texture and lack of flavor of the product and just use the pasta as a filler to help keep you full.  From now on I will stay away from all recipes suggesting sea spaghetti.
