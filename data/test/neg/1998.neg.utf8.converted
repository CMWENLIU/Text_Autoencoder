After reading the ingredients list on this product  I know I will never buy or drink any. I would be telling anyone I can how unhealthy this drink is. Whey protein is a debatable protein source. I prefer a protein powder such as hemp. It is easily digested and mixes well with liquids. The only way soy is healthful is if it is fermented, like tofu. This product contains 18 grams of sugar, which is very high. The carbohydrates are also high at 29 grams. The cocoa is processed with alkali. There are mono and diglycerides in this drink. The vitamin k1 that is used is not very absorbable and not recommended by those who understand vitamin k and which source is most usable by the human body. If I am going to spend good money on a product it will be for something that supports good health. I can't say this product is much good for anything but making money off of those who will not know better. I prefer to make my own protein drink which is much healthier and I know where the ingredients come from.
