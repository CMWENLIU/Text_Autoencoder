Okay - I have to start out saying that I really love this company.  Having lived in Austin and loved Daily Juice, my heart wants them to win. However, this product is really terrible.  It is so caked on with goop that it is heavy and fatty and you might as well have a dorito instead!  I LOVED their original recipe..it was so light and yummy - it tasted good AND it was actually healthy - what a concept!  I now eat Lydia's - because those kale chips are at least a tad bit lighter.  Again, I wish them success - but they gotta get back on the health bandwagon with these puppies.
