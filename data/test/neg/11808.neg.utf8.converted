Not what I was expecting. I bought this tree a week ago for a welcoming home gift for my wife. When I received the tree in the mail, I was very disappointed with the size of the tree. The tree had one sprig of green about the size of a plum. The pot and the tree looked nothing like the picture. I had to run out to another bonsai tree store 2 hours away to fix this problem.
