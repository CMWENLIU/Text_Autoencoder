Another reason not to buy this (from Newdsay):<br /><br />"A Sea Cliff food company said Thursday it was recalling a snack called Veggie Booty because it had been alerted by the federal government of possible salmonella contamination."<br /><br />Ouch! Eating this product will not only make you fat, but now it could kill you! Make your own popcorn instead.
