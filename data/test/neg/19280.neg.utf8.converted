I have Keurig at works and I drank variety of brewers all the time.  Finally decide to buy a unit at home for myself.  Amazon sales it in a bundle and it looks like a good deal, so I bought the samplers.  It is unfortunately a wrong thing to do.  I don't know whether it is due to the pressure during the shipments, several cups lose their tight seal upon arrival.  We didn't notice until we put it in the unit and some of the coffee grounds leaked it into the cup.  I also notice some sampler tasted stale.  Perhaps it is from the shipper, but it is bad.  You will be better off just go to Publics, Target, or Beals to buy them fresh.<br />About a third of the items on this 35 different sampler amount to either lose sealed or bad taste items.  I don't know if it is even possible to ask for a refund?  Does it worth my time and postage to mail them back??
