I just got my order and I think it's just ok.  I got 50 different K-Cups, sure.  I was hoping to get a good mix of coffee, tea, cocoa and maybe an apple cider.  I was secretly hoping for a brew over ice variety, as well.  No such luck.  I got mostly coffee and a few teas.  Some of the coffees were sort of doubles, even though not technically.  By that I mean that I would get a french vanilla and a french vanilla decaf.  So, there were at least 5 flavors that I got with a decaf of the same flavor.  My biggest issue with these is the expiration dates.  My K-Cups had expiration dates ranging from 3 months ago to 1/2013.  In fact, my batch had 5 expired K-Cups.  The expiration dates for them were early February, so that's not even close to being good.  I wasn't too happy to find that 10% of my order was expired.  Perhaps this is just a fluke or perhaps I'm the only one who wrote a review that checked the expiration dates on every single K-Cup received.  I may try this again in a few months to see if I get the same result.  If I do, I'll add an update to this review.
