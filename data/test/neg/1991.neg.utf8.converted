I ordered these tootsie roll pops thinking they were the original flavors (orange,cherry,chocolate,grape,&?). What I got was green apple (which is gross by the way!),strawberry (barely ok),cherry & chocolate (the only 2 good flavors in the bunch), blue raspberry, & watermelon (another gross flavor!). The advertisement blurb on the amazon site indicated that the flavors were the original flavors (orange etc.). I didn't want to ship the whole order back so I just used the ones in the order (from the "Toy Burg" supplier) and am ordering again from another supplier that I had previously used that represented the correct box (this one being "The Candy Co."). So be cautious who you order from because the amazon site does not indicate the exact flavors. I had to call to find out why I got the (wrong) misrepresented flavors & it wasn't easy even then to find out why I got the wrong type. The main lesson here is check your supplier and if all else fails you may have to use trial & error to get the correct item.
