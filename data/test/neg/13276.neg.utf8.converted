I purchased this as a gift for a family member. I've seen this hot chocolate in stores but I was drawn in by the package, the fact that it all came packed in one neat box. Unfortunately when I received it, this was not the case. I literally received single packets of hot chocolate minus the box, any box!<br /><br />I have nothing but great things to say about the quality of the product itself, this collection of hot chocolate is yummy! I'm just upset at the fact that this was supposed to be a gift and because of horrid display I had to purchase boxes to neatly pack it all in. So not only did I pay $25 with shipping, I now had to spend an additional $3.50 for a box. Not a great value if you ask me.<br /><br />The packets are delivered loose, so why not say that on the site? I think a heads up was in order here...
