I really like this soup although I have to lower my 5 star rating to 2 stars.  The last time I paid $15.63 and today I received an E-Mail advertisement for $20.74, a 33% price increase.  By the way, Bob's Red Mill Soup Bean Seasoning increased a whopping 48% up to $47.55.  When you get an E-Mail about one of your favorite products that Amazon tracks, don't just assume they're passing on a price bargain!<br />UPDATE:  Two days later after my original post the price has now decreased by $1.33 to $19.41.  I'm a seasoned Amazon customer who is generally very satisfied.  Although after following the price fluctuations I kind of feel like I'm involved in the stock market.
