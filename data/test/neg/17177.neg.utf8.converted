How do you make $400 Million dollars a year with 1 product? Sell imported irradiated, pasteurized "fruit juice(?)" as a nutritional supplement.<br /><br />Where are the ingredients on this product? Shouldn't they be listed on this page?<br /><br />My chiropractor pressured me into buying a $40. bottle of "Xango." I got out my magnifying glass so I can tell you the  ingredients: citric acid, natural flavor, pectin, xanthum gum, sodium bensoate. Citric acid, yum, natural flavor,yum, pectin to thicken it up, and irratiated xanthum gum, and sodiom benzoate, an ingredient in fireworks which is used as a preservative, which combined with ascorbic acid (vit c such is found in fruit) forms benzene a known carcinogen. The additive sodiom benzoate is also thought to contribute to hyperactivity in children.<br /><br />Like I said, I bought a bottle of this to please my chiropractor, drank it at the medium dosage, and as I was finishing the bottle, fell sicker than I have been in years, with summer cold and flu symptoms.<br /><br />Well there's a sucker born every minute. I'd pay $40. for a bottle of something to cure my gullibility.
