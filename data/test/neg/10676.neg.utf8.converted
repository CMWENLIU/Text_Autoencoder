WARNING!! These are no longer made by Jelly Belly!! When they first came out, Jelly Belly handled them and they were great, yes even the nasty flavors...well, at least they were authentically flavored anyway. Now, evidently the folks at Warner Bros. decided to go cheap after the license ran out for jelly Belly. These new ones by some candy company I've never heard of are HORRIBLE. Even the ones that are supposed to taste good. They don't taste much like what they're supposed to and we had trouble figuring out what flavor was what. These don't taste much better than the cheapo jelly beans you can find at Easter. I had assumed based on the similar packaging that they were the same. The odd shaped little uglies should have given me a clue...Jelly Belly NEVER puts those in with their regular beans.<br /><br />Unless you're just into torturing your palette, steer clear of these rip-offs. They're a poor substitute for the originals.
