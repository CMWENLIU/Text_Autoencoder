I use 5 Hour Energy - it's a great little product. But this listing is rediculous. The image shows a box, the description is "2OZ Grape5HR XEnergy", and the price is $28.89 - with free shipping too! Is that a good value? WHO KNOWS?!? Nowhere does the listing tell you HOW MANY bottles are in the box!!
