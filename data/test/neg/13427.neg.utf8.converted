I received this order today with a MAJOR problem!  I did not taste it because the labels no where had "RAW" on them, as it is in the picture. If it is not raw, it is as useless to me as commercial white sugar (granted, it is a tad bit healthier).<br /><br />Amazon has refused to take it back but I have written to them to try and find a solution.<br /><br />This is the second major problem I have add with Amazon in the past few days and you can check my review on the Casio Men's AMW 320D watch (they actually sent me the 320R, even though the box said 320D!!!, which went bad shortly after I received it). They refused to help me here as well, even though it was their fault, and I may not be able to get the repair(s)  done under the warranty because the Model numbers don't match on the receipt....again, their fault.<br /><br />Will let you know what happens. I will not deal with a company I cannot trust and is not fair.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/09/2011: I am pleased to say that Amazon gave me a full refund for the honey order and apologized for the misleading information. They still could not accept a return  of the honey because of health issues so I will dispose of it as best I can, but in no way eat it myself.<br /><br />They also agreed to replace the Casio watch if  Casio refused to repair it under the warranty.<br /><br />They bent their rules to reach a fair settlement and that should be greatly admired.
