I had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant... so I ordered this one and... I shouldn't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange... not pleasant... now we're stuck with 12x4 of something we don't like... hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake...
