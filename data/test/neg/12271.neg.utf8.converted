After reading the many positive reviews here on Amazon, I bought a bag of this chocolate cake mix at a local store, and baked cupcakes last night.<br /><br />Just for the record, this is the third brand of gluten-free chocolate cake mix I have tried, and I really liked the other two: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVHYC">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 26-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQP5IE">Betty Crocker Gluten Free Devil's Food Cake Mix, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />Also, I'm somewhat of a chocolate cake connoisseur.  The chocolate cake I used to bake before going gluten-free often received comments that it was the best chocolate cake people had ever eaten.<br /><br />I find it difficult to account for the many enthusiastic comments about this cake.  As soon as I began pouring the mix into a bowl, I noticed the odor of what I assume was the "natural flavor".  It smelled almost perfumey, out of place, and definitely not like any ingredient I would have ever used in my baking.  But I still hoped that, when baked, the cupcakes would taste good.<br /><br />While the finished cupcakes had an excellent appearance and texture (even the next day, and after having been frozen), the taste was awful.  There was an "off", unnatural taste about them, and they were too salty.<br /><br />I much prefer the Namaste and Betty Crocker mixes, and definitely will not be buying this one again.
