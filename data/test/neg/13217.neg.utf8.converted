Last Valentines Day, I ordered a dozen berries for my wife. They were GREAT! Huge, Fresh, very tasty, great dipped chocolate strawberries. Even well packaged... BUT, this year they must have had a bad day or something's amiss at Sheri's. 8 of the 12 were no bigger than a teaspoon head, the others about the tablespoon size. After biting into them, half were green and not ripe, hard. The chocolate "drizzle" was either machined on or some 5 year old had a great time.<br /><br />My wife was really disappointed and so was I for 41.47 of my hard earned money. Sorry Sheri, won't be buying again. Two stars, there was some chocolate on them.
