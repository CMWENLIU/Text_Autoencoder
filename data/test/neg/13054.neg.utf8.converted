I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH.
