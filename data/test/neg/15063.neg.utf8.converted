I've tried the original Splenda version of this syrup, and it did taste like root beer, even if it did have an odd aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't say the same of the finished product with the Sparkling Natural root beer syrup. I've made multiple batches using filtered water, using syrup to the fill line of the cap and beyond - and it still ends up tasting like tea.<br /><br />Yes, you can taste a hint of root beer in all of that tea flavor, but on the whole it is a weak one. I can't say if it's the carmelized sugar that's throwing off the taste, or if they just didn't get the proportions right for the flavoring, but this is a syrup I'll have to pass on in the future.<br /><br />But who knows, SodaStream could have a new winner on its hands - carbonated herbal tea.
