I had high hopes for this litter after having it highly recommended from a local pet store. The plus was that it was super light and the bag claimed that 10 liters was to last a single cat a month! I happily cleaned out the old litter and replaced it with the green tea leaves and found that in actuality the odor control was not that great. We have a small apartment and must keep the litter box in the foyer, so if the box is not fresh you smell it immediately upon entering. While it seemed to do pretty well with concealing urine smells it took many hours (like 4-6) before the poop smell was absorbed. I resorted to pouring baking soda in the box everyday even after cleaning it and it still smelled bad. Also, while it claims to be low tracking, we still found these large pellets all over the house. This bag that was claimed to last a month ended up lasting less then two weeks...we are moving on to the next litter.
