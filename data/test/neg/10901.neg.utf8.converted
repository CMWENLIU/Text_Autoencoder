This tea (chai) does not taste anything close to real Indian masala cha. It is more like milky, weak tea with some funny flavor. This is very different from the aromatic tea you can make from loose Indian tea and fresh ginger. It is a mixer of little weak tea powder thrown in with whole black pepper, whole cardamom and other whole things.<br />After boiling, you end up throwing all these good-looking whole masalas without getting much out of them. The proper thing would have been to make a "masala" powder out of these whole things to get some aroma in your chai.<br />If you have ever tried an authentic masala chai, not the hyped type you get in some fancy stores, you know what I mean. I won't buy it again. It is all packing and no substance.
