I feel bad writing a bad review, but I feel cheated and I don't believe other people should buy this product based on my experience with it. Maybe other products of theirs are good, but this one is exceptionally bad, especially since it is supposed to be gourmet. The small bottles of vanilla that you can buy at Walmart taste much, much, much, much, much more like vanilla than this product, which tastes to me, like vodka with a dash of vanilla in it. I feel like I have been cheated, even though for the price it should be a good value. I am actually scared to purchase vanilla now on the Internet in bulk other than from companies I can find and try out in the stores. I can only speak about the bottle I purchased. I would recommend something else. Most vanilla is gluten free although many have corn syrup in them. This one has sugar in it. I really don't understand positive reviews about this product. I bought it because it was cheap (for the amount) and gourmet. It (I think, tastes worse than the imitation). Imitation at least tastes like vanilla. I apologize for writing such a review but other people need to be aware of this product. If you want to buy from this company try something that will have more vanilla in it.
