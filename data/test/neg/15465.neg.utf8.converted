I ordered this item for a business trip and a demonstration that I was presenting. After I ordered the item I received information about the shipping arrival time. I was worried that they may not arrive in time for my presentation so I tried to contact the seller several times through the contact information that was provided by the seller. I was never able to make contact and my request for a phone call never was answered. Needless to say, the items did not arrive in time for my presentation, and to this day I still don't know if they ever arrived since they still had not arrived by the time that I had to leave for home. It was a very bad experience with this seller.
