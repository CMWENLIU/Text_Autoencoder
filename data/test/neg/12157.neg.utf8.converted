I bought this decaffeinated Midsummer's Peach tea directly from Harney, when they had it on sale for $5.95 a tin. I don't know if there was some mixup with the decaffeination process or what, but the tea in the tin I received certainly had some sort of stimulant in it -- if not caffeine, then something just as potent. I know tea contains theophylline and theobromine as well as caffeine. But I was expecting less of a stimulant effect from this tea than I get from regular tea, not more of one. I'm still baffled as to whether I received "caffeinated" peach tea that was mispackaged, or whether the removal of the caffeine somehow increased the amount of theophylline and/or theobromine enough to offset removal of caffeine.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I was a bit disappointed. It's not the worst tea I've ever had, but usually Harney tea tastes better. The peach flavor wasn't even the best "fake peach" flavor I've ever tasted. And if the tea doesn't have the benefit of no caffeine (or other stimulants), you might as well buy a better tasting tea.
