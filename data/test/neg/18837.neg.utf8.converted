problem #1:<br />the price.<br />$11.75 is ridiculous when it's $4 in most grocery stores (look for it in the spice aisle, on the bottom shelf)... it's SALT for cryin' out loud.<br />good thing it qualifies for free shipping with a $25 purchase!<br /><br />problem #2:<br />the description is wrong.<br />yes, it's a "pack" "of three pounds" but that's it.<br />the next two items contradict themselves... and the first one is wrong.  it does NOT contain iodine.  kosher salt, by definition, cannot contain iodine.  the anti-caking agent is yellow prussiate of soda.<br />so, the third statement is OBVIOUSLY wrong, because it DOES contain an additive.<br />jeez.<br />"Pack contains of 3 pounds<br />Table salt mixed with iodine to prevent goiter and anti-caking agent<br />Contains no additives"<br /><br />problem #3:<br />it contains an additive.<br />it's NOT pure salt.  so, it's no good for pickling (it can turn the pickles mushy) or making preserved lemons, which i love.<br /><br />i was looking for kosher salt and couldn't remember the name of the one i like so well (and which is hard to find in my area) so i just did a search for "kosher salt".  when this popped up, i was quite surprise to see the price, so i looked at the product and was amazed... and not in a good way.<br /><br />i have used this product and still have a box on the shelf in the pantry.  i won't be buying it again because of the additives.  apparently, morton does not make a salt without additives... even their sea salt has yellow prussiate of soda.  so... sorry, morton.<br /><br />i will buy the diamond crystal kosher salt from now on.  NO additives, just SALT.
