The description says "DOP Certified" and the photo shows "Pomodoro S. Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino" inscription, mandatory for the real thing. The cans we received today have neither DOP label nor the inscription. I mean, it's still decent canned tomatoes, but without DOP cert. they can be got at half the price...
