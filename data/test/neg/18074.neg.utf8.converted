If you purchase this product, have plenty of paper towels nearby.  The wine will leak from the sides of the device and you will be cleaning up after you pour wine through it.  I would recommend swishing your wine in the glass or leaving the bottle open for a period of time rather than putting up with the mess that is created from the design flaw.
