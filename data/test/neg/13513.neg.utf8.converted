I bought like 6 of these off asianfoodgrocer.com (which is cheaper btw). 1st when I opened the package, they had a fishy smell to them, which totally skeeved me out! But when boiling them the smell did go away. So then ate them, I HATED the texture, couldnt get passed it and wound up throwing them out. I tried the next day with different seasonings but still thought it was gross. I think it was the fishy smell in my head and the texture combined why I don't like them. If your going to try them I would not buy from amazon, I would go to asianfoodgrocer.com because it's cheaper & not to order 6 bags like I did in case you don't like them.
