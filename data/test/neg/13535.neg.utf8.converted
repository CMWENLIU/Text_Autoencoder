Everything great thing that has been said about these liners is probably true--except for the LARGE part.  I received my case of liners the day before I had to make 60 large cupcakes and was I ever surprised when I saw that they are only little more than an inch tall!  So, here I am scrambling to find something else to use at the last minute and won't be able to do so without driving 75 miles each way.  Then, what to do with 1,440 cupcake liners I don't want?  Can't return them.
