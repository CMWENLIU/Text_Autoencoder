I've had my Tassimo for about a month and have been trying different coffees.  I read the reviews on Verona and went against my better judgment and bought a package.  I'm not a Starbucks fan -- think their coffee is way too bitter, burnt and strong.  I like a strong espresso from other makers, but Starbucks gives me heartburn.  Well, the Starbucks Verona T-disc won't disappoint if you like their coffee to begin with, but watch out if you don't.  It is the same old burnt, strong, bitter acidic stuff.  Not sure how they've made such a business from bad coffee.<br /><br />The Gavalia espresso is way better, just add some extra water for a great cafe creme.  And the Gavalia Morning roast is great if you cut out an ounce or so of water.
