After following the rather simple instructions (add one packet to 8oz of hot water and stir), I was extremely disappointed. The soup produced tastes and looks nothing like miso soup. Now I'm stuck with 47 more packets I have no intention of eating.<br /><br />Trust me, just buy another brand. This one is horrible.
