We have 2 old Indoor Tabby cats about 12 years old who will eat ANYTHING and are 20 & 22 pounds. These monsters are still a terror that is fitting for their names of Lucy & Ethel...But I have to crush these up into crumbly pieces small enough for them to sample. First time they both LOVED it. Then Lucy threw it up and she has only thrown up 1 or 2 times in 12 years. Ethel throws up a few times ever week but did fine. From that time on however, they BOTH simply refused ever trying this food treat. So off we go to the neighbors & friends at work. 2 other families had the problem that NONE of the 6 other cats we tried would even try a sample of this food. We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?
