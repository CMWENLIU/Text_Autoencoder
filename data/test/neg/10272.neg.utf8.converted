We have enjoyed using regular Splenda for years so when they came out with Splenda Essentials we thought we'd try one with Vitamin B...... We should have realized that there was a problem as soon as the packet was opened.... The smell of the vitamin was there and when you put it in your coffee, tea, cereal or what ever you put it in the vitamin taste is there and it is HORRIBLE !!!!!!!.... We returned the box of Splenda Essentials to the store for a refund and will NEVER buy it again....HORRIBLE TASTE !!!!
