I purchased a couple of bottles for my co-workers and myself to try, and I am regretting it. Now I wasn't expecting much from this in the first place since it's a novelty drink, and I knew it wasn't going to taste exactly like a strip of bacon. However the smell of the drink was awful, it tasted like flat Diet Pepsi, and the aftertaste killed any joy I had in tasting this concoction.<br /><br />I would only recommend purchasing this drink to use as a collector item/display, or to play a prank on someone by switching out their drink.
