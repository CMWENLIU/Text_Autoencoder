Maybe I was incorrect in thinking that this was the Sesame Seed Oil normally used in Oriental cooking. This oil is basically flavorless, like a Canola oil. It makes a decent cooking oil but if you're looking for the flavor of dark Sesame Seed oil, this product isn't it. It simply does NOT have the smoky, nutty flavoring that I was expecting. The couple Oriental dishes I prepared with it lacked the flavor you get when using the dark oil. Not a bad oil, just not what I thought I was buying. If you're looking for a light, flavorless Sesame Oil then this is the one.
