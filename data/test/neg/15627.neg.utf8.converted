I placed an order in October 25th 2011, and received in the next week. The products were supposed to be good by February 2012.  Knowing this is organic product, I did not have problem with that. It tasted great. Good portion for little kids. However, I just found out some of the cartons started leaking and grew mold (and it is still mid January!). It must be packaging issue. I have seen the same company having packing issues with baby jar food. I am very sorry that we wasted about the half of what we have gotten because we really liked them! We will have to pick different ones next time.
