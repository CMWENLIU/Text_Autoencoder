When I first bought Nestle (Nescafe) Mountain Blend Coffee, (with the extra smooth taste), several years ago, I thought that the "blend" in the name referred to several different types of mountain-grown coffee.  Silly me!  The "blend" herein is instant coffee mixed with another, NON-COFFEE ingrediewnt!  It's been several years since I bought this coffee, and I'm not near a supermarket, so I can't give you the name of the other ingredient....but I do remember it started with an "M". It's an OK additive for instant coffee, I guess....but when a customer, (at least, THIS customer), comes across a coffee which calls itself "Mountain-Blend Coffee", with an "extra-smooth taste", one would expect the "extra smooth taste" to come from the COFFEE BLEND.  But no such "blend of coffees" here.  Nope.  Just coffee, (I suspect only one type), and the for-now mysterious "M" ingredient, (you cn read it, in small letters, on the label of every jar of this coffee....in the supermarket, that is.  (There is, as of this date, NO mention of this extra ingredient here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Of course, it's possible that NOW, there really IS a blend of several different coffees in this "Mountain Blend Coffee."  It's been several years since I was SO disappointed, that I haven't spent the time or energy looking for this particular instant coffee in the supermarket for at least fuur years.  However, the ingredients are NOT listed here on Amazon, (be they several types of coffee OR just the one coffee with the non-coffee "smoothing" ingredien), so one does not know.  However, the label STILL proclaims how "smooth" this coffee is, so I suspect it's the same one I hurriedly bought without looking at he label, several years ago.  My advice:  Look At The Label.  Of thi coffee....of every coffee, and of everything else you buy, in the supermarkt or out of it.<br /><br />Nestles makes the excellent "Taster's Choice" Coffee line.  EVERY one of these coffees is totally superb.  And every one of them is also 100% coffee.  If you really want a "coffee blend", do what I do -- mix the various Taster's Choice Coffees, (and Maxwell House Instant, and any other intant ccffees you happen to have around the house, togther.  Place in a large cannister, (usually used for flower or sugar), and shake or stir.  THAT is a blend of ALL COFFEE!<br />100%.  I sadly suspect that Nestle's "Mountain-Blend" coffee, is still NOT a coffee blend, nor is it 100% coffee.  Go the supermarket, check the label, and see!  :(
