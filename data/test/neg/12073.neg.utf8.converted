I am reluctant to share details with strangers, but I will report that after I became ill, lab tests showed that this item is not Matcha, and the "alien" Asian seller was abusive and would not reimburse me until Amazon Security intervened. I am now buying Costco's Kirkland Signature Matcha green tea, and it is best brewed in a cup (not in a tea pot) and cost only $13 dollars for 100 bags!
