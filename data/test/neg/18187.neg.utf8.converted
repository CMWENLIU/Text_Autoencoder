With four of us in the family that are wheat and gluten intolerant, we attempted to use this item to make biscuits for our Thanksgiving feast. Although the flours are ground quite fine, after mixing all ingredients, we found this was still quite "wet". Attempting to roll it out, cut it out, and then place in on a baking sheet proved a real test to patience! The biscuits came out flat, crumbly, and not high on our choice.
