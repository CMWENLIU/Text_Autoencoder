I won't take up too much of your time. This is the singular worst tasting Shells and Cheese (Mac and Cheese) product I've ever had. The cheese has the most bitter aftertaste and is so unappealing even my cats would not eat it! I rarely, if ever, review food products but this one is so bad that I felt I must just to do my public duty!<br /><br />So, for our house, its 6 thumbs and 8 paws down! Awful!
