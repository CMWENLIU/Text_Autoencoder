I have a very active compost bin, complete with red wriggler worms. I bought a set of these bags, some kitchen size, some leaf size, and dog waste size. All fail miserably to compost. After more than a year, when I was turning the oldest compost into bins of humus, I found loads of unaffected plastic bags, this color.<br /><br />Don't buy these. Say what they will, they are impervious to rot after more than a year in a warm, moist, heavily populated compost bin.
