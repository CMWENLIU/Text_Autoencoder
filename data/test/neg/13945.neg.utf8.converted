These candies arrived in a timely manner.  I was very excited to open them as they were to be a Christmas Present for my father.<br /><br />I opened the box to find a paper cup and smashed sticky candy mess in a plastic baggie.  It looked like they ran out of the size box I ordered,  took a larger box or multiple smaller boxes, grabbed the pieces out of the box they came in dumped them in a plastic bag.  It was disgusting!  I have contacted them twice by e-mail (their preferred method)  they have yet to respond.<br /><br />I am not happy with the product or the customer service.
