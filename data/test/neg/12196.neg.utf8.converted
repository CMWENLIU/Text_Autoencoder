I just came back from Mardi Gras and had Gumbo/Jambalaya and all the other great food. I was sure this wasn't going to be that good but it tasted fine. The biggest problem I have is the picture that shows big chunks of okra, vegetables and sausage. There were only two chunks of any kind of vegetables in there one tomato and one celery. No Okra at all, and only one small piece of sausage and a few strands of meat of any kind. I don't know if that's what it takes to make it healthier (cheaper to produce). It probably wouldn't be too bad if you added more rice (small amount compared to New Orleans version I had) and your own sausage pieces, okra and misc. vegetables. It isn't bad tasting just disappointing "presentation" vs. what you receive. It is a base basically not a stew or soup.
