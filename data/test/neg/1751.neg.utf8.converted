I bought these beans hoping they would be good quality, but I was disappointed upon opening the package to see how many broken beans there were and how much dust was at the bottom of each bag.<br /><br />Those which weren't split in the bag came apart during the soaking.  This means my cooked beans will look even worse<br /><br />I am used to Greek 'giant limas', which soak to become huge and remain whole in the process. Now I've got a huge quantity of a product I don't want.<br /><br />I was annoyed to see that Amazon will not accept returns for food products, because I think this is really inferior quality.
