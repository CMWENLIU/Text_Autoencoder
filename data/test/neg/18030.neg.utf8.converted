I was alarmed by the smell when pouring hot water over the oatmeal and was hesitant to even try a bite. It tasted even worse than it smelled -- a very "chemical" kind of flavor. It addition, it was way too sweet. I threw it out.<br /><br />I used to like the regular Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal. I suppose whatever they did to make the "Weight Control" version is what caused the problem. It has a truly heinous flavor. It's hard to understand how this made it out of product testing.
