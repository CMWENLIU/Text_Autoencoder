In the description online the ingredients reads as follows:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Cranberry Juice, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br /><br />The actual ingredients listed on the bottle are:<br />Cranberry Juice (Filtered Water, Cranberry Juice Concentrate) Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br /><br />There is a difference between Cranberry Juice and Cranberry Juice from concentrate.<br /><br />I will not buy it again.
