I really wanted to like these bags because they are compostable.  However, they rip WAY to easily.  I removed a full bag from the kitchen trash can and it had several holes in it, so I tried to double bag it.  When I put the full bag into an empty one, it just ripped the empty bag completely open.  These bags would probably work fine for trash that doesn't have any sharp corners, but for the kinds of things I throw away in the kitchen, these bags just are not going to work.  I will not be buying them again for that purpose until they are more durable.
