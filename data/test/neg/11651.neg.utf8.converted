I purchased this coffee with high anticipation after I heard it being raved about by the morning radio DJ's.  I was disappointed when I received and tried it for myself.  It doesn't really taste like a chocolate doughnut, if anything it tastes like the hardened glaze that covers the doughnut.  It also has somewhat of a chemically aftertaste.
