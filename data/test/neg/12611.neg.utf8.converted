there is NO pink in this salmon..it is cooked so much it is white...think a can of tune...but at the higher price you pay here for salmon...very hard to tell just what fish this is...you have to take it on faith i guess it is what they say it is.....<br /><br />ultra strong fish smell, not like fresh fish smells...friends across the hall will know you are having some old fish for dinner....<br /><br />the taste is a gag-fest-palooza.........<br /><br />the amount in the can is TINY, the weight is in the liquid<br />the salmon is sure not firm, it is mushy...<br />add the skin and bones for more mush and more gag...<br /><br />this is a never buy again item....
