Saw this in the grocery store recently and was very excited. As a fan of the previous fruit filled version, I was eager to try a bowlful as soon as I got home. The mixed berry flavor was very sweet & artificial, and by the time I'd eaten less than half the bowl I'd had enough.<br />  The flavors from before like strawberry and raisin tasted very fruity and complimented the frosted shredded cereal perfectly. When there is already frosting on the top side of the square, the filling doesn't need to be super sweet.  It tasted like a frosted mixed berry Pop Tart, so I'm sure kids and younger folk will be a fan on this cereal, and perhaps that is who it is marketed to now.
