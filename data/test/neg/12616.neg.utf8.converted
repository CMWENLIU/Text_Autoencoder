After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision.
