We just bought 3 cans for $3.00 each at JobLot.  Granted, JobLot is a discount place and these cans sell for $5.00 each. We love Lobster Bisque. We love all types, restaurant, canned, supermarket, whatever....  We opened up one can up today and four of us tried it. It tasted horrible!!  It was brown and tasted like bad fish.  No lie. All of us were repulsed.  I looked up the reviews on the internet, like here, thus wondering if Bar Harbor made a bad batch and sold them off to Job Lot. Anyways, we have two more cans to try. We will certainly not buy this brand again.
