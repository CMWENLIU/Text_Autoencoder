I found this product to be a major disappointment.  I tried the Acai Pomegranate flavor.  It did not taste like either acai berry or pomegranate to me.<br /><br />To use the product, you snip open the packet and mix the powered contents with 8 ounces of water.  It mixed easily and dissolved completely.  The taste was tolerable, but not pleasant.  It was sort of like a bland kool-aid as I drank it, but with a slightly tart aftertaste.<br /><br />As far as being a healthy energy drink, while it has several ingredients which are good for you, the aforementioned fruit flavors, as well as vitamins B-12, C, and D, and some minerals such as zinc, it also contains caffeine.  The maker states that the caffeine is naturally-occurring from green tea extract and is equivalent to the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee.  I am not a crusader against caffeine, but what goes up must come down, and if you are going to get "energy" from caffeine that's not really energy in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't think there are any bad things in the drink though, no abundance of man-made junk sweeteners and so on.<br /><br />And it is true it has a good dose of vitamins in it.  The B-12 dose is huge at 2,500 mcg.  You may reap more benefits some vitamin supplements and a nice cup (hot or cold) of green tea, and if you need it you'll still get a dose of caffeine in the tea.<br /><br />Considering the poor flavor, the caffeine "energy" and the price, well over $1 per drink for the packet of powder..... in the end I found Eboost to be quite a let down.
