I used this product, and my family hated it! we have found that Oat flour is the best solution, the flavor of this product was so overpowering that you could not taste the other ingrediants, flour is suppose to be used as a base, to take on the flavors of the other ingrediants in the recipe, this product has a opposite effect , it has a horrid aftertaste. In todays economy we cant afford to throw away food because a product has a poor flavor. Dont waste your money on this!
