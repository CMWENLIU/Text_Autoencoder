And by haunt you, I mean in the form of vomit all over the place. Though my dog, a 150lb. Newfoundland, absolutely loved the bone but even after just a few minutes chewing it, he had managed to gnaw off some bone slivers and swallowed them. Shortly after that he was throwing up, not just the bone slivers, but everything he had eaten for what seemed like days. So, while it seemed great to give him a treat that he loved so thoroughly, the aftermath just wasn't worth it.
