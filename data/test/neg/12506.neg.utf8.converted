This 'turkey and dressing' unit was better tasting than some of the other Hormel microwaveable products I bought recently to try out.  It still has way to much salt but at least the flavor is decent.  Again, the gravy is substantial and helps mask the blandness of the turkey and stuffing. However, I will NOT be buying this product again.  At almost 1,500 mg of salt, ~ 30 to 45 grams of carbohydrates, ~3 to 20 grams of sugar and ~10 to 15% of saturated fat per serving this would not be considered a good diet for anyone.  They do have 13 to 24 grams of protein in the form of "hydrogenated" corn, soy, and wheat protein.  They also have MSG hidden in the ingredients list as 'autolyzed yeast extract'.  I find it hard to believe that this big company can not make a decent product that is not loaded with CRAP!  I DO NOT recommend this product at all!!!
