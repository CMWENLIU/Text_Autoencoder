**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled "Savory Chicken Flavor". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it "Savory" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.
