Generally, the flavored Vita Coco varieties are anywhere from alright to very good tasting.  However, this one is outright unpleasant.  There's a strong undertone to this drink that can only be described as medicinal.  It tastes like something you'd drink only if you *had* to in order to speed your recovery from some nasty intestinal bug.<br /><br />Just blech! across the board.
