When I placed the original order it was not delivered. Then a replacement one was sent and when my wife received them they were limp and would not stand up in the vase. These flowers were suppose to be a surprise delivered on the day we found out what sex our baby is. I am very disappointed in this service. I have bought a lot of things off of Amazon.com and never had any issues, in fact I have been thrilled with everything excepy this flower service.
