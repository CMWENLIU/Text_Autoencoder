I grew up making Appian Way pizza's.  For 50 years I enjoyed them. After moving to an area where they are not available in the local stores  and not being able to get them from Dial Corp anymore, I sorta gave up enjoying them again.  Then I FOUND them on Amazon.  With great anticipation I awaited the arrival of part of my childhood.  Ripping open the carton and seeing the the package brought back memories of Mom and I making pizza on a saturday night. Mixing, spreading adding cheese and toppings I could hardly wait.  Then "the moment" arrived, the pizza was golden brown and smelled oh so yummy.  I excitedly took my first bite only to be hugely disappointed. After a few more bites it was obvious,  someone messed with MY pizza. The sauce is not what it was just a few years ago, let alone what it was 50 years ago. Its nothing more than ketchup with some gook added... what a disappointment.  A good product and once again, someone, probably to save a few pennies, ruined a good product.<br /><br />The only thing similar to what Appian Way use to be is the box, and perhaps, the box is the better than whats inside.  One more disappointment from the corporate world.<br /><br />I must recommend NOT to purchase this product if you have ever eaten pizza before, you will be totally disappointed.
