This product's ingredient profile on the Earth's Best website does not list "Syrup Solids"; however, buyers should be aware that the formula has recently changed to now include this ingredient.  Their website has not yet been updated to reflect this (as of 7/18/2010).<br /><br />I spoke with their consumer relations department and asked them to update their website since the misinformation is misleading to consumers.  The change in ingredient profile to include syrup solids is disappointing.  I am now researching other formulas.
