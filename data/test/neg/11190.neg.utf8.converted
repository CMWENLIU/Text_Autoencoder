Tasty, yes ... but if you like eating margarine straight from the tub, with even more types solidified oils, add artificial coloroing and brand and label it so it resembles peanut butter (a natural butter), add sugar and spice and all that's nice ... this stuff is for you. Bought it ... loved it ... then found out what it really is ... fools gold.
