I purchased 2 packages this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits. But this coffee has creamer made with glucose solids and a "mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS". How could they put this terrible Trans fat oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their "CNI Tongkat Ali with Ginseng Coffee" and it does not look any healthier with "Hardened Vegetable FAT (coconut, palm kernel Oil). Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the ingredients. They listed the good ingredients but failed to mention the BAD ones!
