Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption "Now with Stevia". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.
