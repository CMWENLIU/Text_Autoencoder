I ordered this for my husband who is deployed in hopes of helping him remember some of his childhood, ie, buying candy from the local candy store..... The concept is a great one, but the amount of candy in the box was a JOKE, they were SAMPLE SIZE AMOUNTS..... you can go to your local Dollar store and create your own kit, pay shipping and still come out spending less money, Also the candy wrappers are the same as the ones you get today, I bought the 70's kit and it was nothing like the candy wrappers form the 70's..... I WOULD NOT WASTE THE MONEY.....
