Now of course I knew that I was getting ginger snaps, so I wanted the taste of ginger to be here, but oh my goodness, for me these cookies are REALLY bitter, way more than the ginger snaps I tried before. I felt as if I burned my mouth a little bit, and after taste stayed with you for some time. And these cookies were really hard too.
