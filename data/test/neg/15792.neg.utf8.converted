I've never reviewed anything before, but have relied on reviews for many purchases.  If this keeps anyone else from buying this new soup thinking it is the same as the old one, then it's worth it.<br /><br />I've purchased and eaten the old version of the Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Chicken Ramen Big Cup Soup for several years.  When I suddenly couldn't get the 2.1 oz soup cups, and this appeared (1.8 oz soup cup), I bought 3 boxes of 6.  I ate the first one a few days ago, and barely could choke it down.<br /><br />The broth in no way resembles chicken broth, it's brown and watery and has a slight trace of miso or soy flavor, with a bitter after taste.<br /><br />YUCK!  Don't buy this, unless or until they re-formulate it again to once again be edible and resemble chicken soup.
