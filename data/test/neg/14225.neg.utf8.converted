This Stainless Steel MIRROR PET DISH 1QT 144 is exactly what it says it is, and is fine in and of itself. However, the huge advertisement sticker that covers the entire inner bottom of the bowl is impossible to remove without spending a good hour or so scrubbing it off. I actually had to soak it in nail polish remover, then scrub it no less than 12 times to fully remove the sticky residue. What a pain!
