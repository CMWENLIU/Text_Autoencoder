I was very disappointed that it was not clear from the label that this<br />quinoa product is actually corn and quinoa.  I cannot eat corn.  There is<br />enough corn in it that it should be called quinoa-corn pasta.<br />I usually read the labels very closely, but I missed this ingredient.  I<br />guess because I know there quinoa cereal is just quinoa.  So I have a stack<br />of food I can't eat.<br />Lots of people who look for quinoa are gluten intolerant.  Corn sensitivity<br />is also very common.  I hope they'll make their label more clear.
