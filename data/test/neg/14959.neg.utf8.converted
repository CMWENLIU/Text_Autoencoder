My husband and I each tried a bowl of this cereal and then threw the rest of the box away. Why? First, it doesn't have much cinnamon flavor compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4ATQ">Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a>. Second, it leaves a strange film on the inside of your mouth, much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0AJX0">Cap'n Crunch, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>. And third, it has a strange texture once it is submerged in milk - the texture which comes to mind most readily is cardboard. I know that is unflattering, but it just doesn't crunch like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52">Cheerios Honey Nut Cereal, 12.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0A6C4">Cheerios Cereal, 14-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)</a> (which we love).
