We were BIG fans of Sprout- had a great experience with a lot of the flavors-until this flavor.  My daughter actually got sick.  The food was thicker and I thought maybe that is they was it was supposed to be-not true. I bought more of the lentil bolganese kind which she absolutley loved and we gave to her quite a few times... I bought several....The first package of the was a thick almost solid consistency.  I opened a total of 5 of the packages and they were all solid-not the experience that I had had in the past except for the parmesean potato. Something was very wrong. I had it happen with 2 of the Parmesean Potato and 5 of the Lentil Bolgenese.  I sent an email to Sprout and didn't hear a word back from them.  There was something seriously wrong with some of their food that was sent out.  I won't be wasting my money or taking my chances with Sprout.  we have had wonderful success with Happy Baby and Plum.
