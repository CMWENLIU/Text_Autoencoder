I became completely addicted to FiberOne. Absolutely loved it, until I read the ingredients label.  I didn't get hungry till lunch time and was losing weight, but I just didn't feel good about aspartame. I am trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWTY4">Benefit Nutrition Simply Fiber, All Natural Crunchy O's 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> by Benefit Nutrition. Not as wonderfully crunchy as FiberOne, but the ingredients label is very short.
