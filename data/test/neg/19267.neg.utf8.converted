This is not zero calorie nor actually sweetened with stevia! This is sweetened with a sugar alcohol, with a little stevia added. Each can has 50 calories and for a diabetic this stuff raises your blood sugar almost as bad as any regular sweetened with sugar soda. And the sugar alcohol gives you horrible gas. A big thumbs down to their false advertising.
