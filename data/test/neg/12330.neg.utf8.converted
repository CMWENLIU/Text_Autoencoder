<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBQUNW">Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft Chews</a><br /><br />The Smart Chews are a very tasty product but I was looking for a product to reduce my high cholesterol without taking statins.  My results came in today after taking 3 a day for a month.  There was no improvement or very little in my LDL.  HDL was OK.  Smart Chews are a nice candy but that was not the objective.  Sorry to give Benecol a bad review.  Everyone's body is different.
