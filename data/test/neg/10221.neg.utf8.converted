I have made my share of GF bread mixes - and while most share the "cake-like" texture of this mix, they at least don't taste like bean-cake. This mix has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It has the cake-like texture of most GF breads, is almost as sweet as Pamela's bread mix, and tastes like dried, crushed beans.<br /><br />I have made this in the oven and in a Zojirushi Virtuoso, and the result was nearly identical both times. I'm not sure what one could call it, but it is NOT bread.<br /><br />The closest I have come to finding "real" bread in a ready made mix is King Arthur's GF bread mix. Pamela's is a tolerable second, and could rival King Arthur's if it just weren't so incredibly over-sugared. I generally like Bob's products, this however is just terrible.<br /><br />Sidenote: I wish the manufacturer's of these GF mixes would take the time (and $$$) to send a small "research" team to Freiburg, Germany. Once there, visit any family-owned bakery and closely examine all the products therein. Take pictures, notes, samples - whatever it takes. Then make a day trip over the French border into the Alsace region and do the same there for Baguette. And finally make a last excursion to Basel, Switzerland and repeat the above procedures.<br /><br />Document your findings, bring them back home, work on your recipes, and then sell us mixes that produce proper bread (it IS possible, even without wheat and rye). That'd be worth five or six Dollars a box/bag.
