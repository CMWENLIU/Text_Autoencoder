We bought the large sifting box, the nicest one (with lid). Did not work for our 2 cats.<br /><br />We used extra-clumping litter, as instructed (that's the kind we use anyway), but the clumps of pee get stuck on the sifter.<br /><br />The "hard" waste sifts out just fine. But the pee causes a huge gummy mess. It's too big & gets stuck on the sifter. Then I had to spend several minutes, each time, shaking & scrubbing the sifter pan into the trash bag. And (hate to be overly descriptive here) if your cat ever has diarrhea, the sifter will get ~really~ messy.<br /><br />I then bought a kitchen scrubber to scrape off the residue each time. I'm laughing, in retrospect, as to how much effort I put into this - I really wanted this to work. I can imagine if you only have one (small) cat who only pees small bits at a time, it may work better.<br /><br />Tried feline pine & also crystals. Successfully sifted out the poop, but the urine just goes straight to the bottom, which *never* gets sifted out. It starts smelling quickly, & you have to manually clean the box.<br /><br />Then, the box has fallen apart on me "twice" while trying to move it - the plastic latches pop off easily. Made a huge mess all over the floor.<br /><br />Then one day I decided this was much more work than my old basic litter box. This is a great idea, wish it worked.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a better product or method, please leave a comment. For auto-sifting, so far I've found the liner bags work better than just about anything. I've also tried toilet training, but the smaller cat jumps into the toilet to give himself a bath if the toilet lid is left open (he loves to swim - we can't stop him from jumping in the tub or shower with us. Yeah, I've got some crazy cats. We love them.)
