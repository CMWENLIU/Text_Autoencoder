I ordered the full dozen gourmet dipped strawberries for my wife for Valentine's day and did so online. I also qualified for a double order because of a promotion. The order I received stated my wife would receive the berries on or before 2/14. Valentine's day came and went, no berries. The next day I tried to use the tracking number through UPS. It didn't work. I called their customer service number and after giving my name, my email address, my home address, and the order number the woman wanted to know who the "recipient" was. I said it was my wife. She said that was incorrect. This went back and forth for a while during which the customer service person was being ruder and ruder and stated that I needed the "magic name" of whom was to receive the package and she couldn't help me unless I gave that. This went on for five minutes until I just stated my own name which was the correct response. If she had asked what name was on the package as generated by the computer when one clicks, "ship to same name and address as billing information," that might have been clearer.<br />After more exchanges, I just asked for my credit card to be credited back and that I did not want their product. The present was late and pretty much pointless as a Valentine's day gift a day after and given the package was shipped in dry ice, it was not likely to be fresh. Eventually, the customer service lady said she credited back my card and let me know after waiting 5 minutes for that to clear. She said I should see it back on my card in 5 to seven days. The berries did arrive but the ice was melted and we opted not to eat the berries as they were room temperature. So while they "gifted" the berries, there wasn't anything to "gift." And, the double order that was part of the promotion was not in the box.<br />Bottom line, they made a promise to have the gift to my wife on or before Valentine's day, they did not deliver. My wife was a good sport about it but it was very disappointing. I can overlook quite a bit but it has been a long time since I was treated so rudely by a customer service person and I would never buy anything from "Shari's Berries" again. Caveat emptor!
