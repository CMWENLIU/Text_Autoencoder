I agree, the new formula is disppointing. The whole reason I was purchasing this cereal was because of the low carb/sugar count. Anyone have any suggestions for an alternative? Just by looking at labels is seems like Cheerios is the best option from a carb standpoint, but I'm sure there are other options out there?
