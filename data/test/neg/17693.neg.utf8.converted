I agree with the first reviewer. This soup has an extremely odd 'industrial' aftertaste. I worried about it as I was slurping it. The ingredients seem wholesome, but the sourcing could be concerning or maybe even the packaging. Their tomato  soup also tastes a bit strange. I think some Q A is warranted and perhaps some chemical / metal testing. I probably won't buy soup  from  Pacific Natural Foods again. Actually, I have to throw out the rest of this soup now. The taste is beginning to make me  really sick...:(
