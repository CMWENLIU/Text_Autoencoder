Might be me, but I am sorry I bought so many packages/how I'm going to eat this is still a mystery. Perhaps cutting the product up in 1 inch pieces. Unless You have razor teeth, this is impossible to chew. Made a batch that has been sitting in tomatoes, and still like rubber bands. I was raised on 'scratch' cooking,might be a personal issue.<br /><br />Reporting back: I used a new pair of scissors and cut noodles up in 1/2 inch pieces. The solution is to swallow the bits w/o chewing. I couldn't throw product on compost heap as I believe the MIRACLE noodle would not break down.<br /><br /> The Miracle in the product name is-if you can get them down without the noodles wrapping around your tonsils,it's a miracle. My father said a hungry man will eat anything,if he is hungry enough/ first time my father was wrong. I also have a sneaking feeling that there might be paid reviewers for this company. Also, I haven't watched a Doctor Oz show since.
