I loved STAGG chili but they all of them seem to have disappeared except this one.  The Chili is OK but it seems like someone took the average Hormel Chili with ground beef and beans, tossed in three to four chunks of tender meat (quarter to half inch cubes), and tried to pass it off as something special.  I would like to say next time I would just buy Hormel chili and save a lot of money instead of this but I won't even do that, Hormel chili was not what I was looking for.
