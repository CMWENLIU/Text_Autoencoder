Some people are nutty. Some candy bars are nutty. Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes U likes to chomp on some nuts. Sometimes U are a nut. Its pretty nutty to not like peanut butter but like peanut butter flavored candy bars. Its even nuttier to like inferior peanut butter tasting candy bars. This would apply here-----Zagnut is clearly inferior to Butterfinger, or even Clark bars. This is like eating the inside of a candy bar. Sure U can eat this nutty bar. But U might as well eat nuts, like U likes to. O, do U see U eating nuts?
