I purchased a smaller version of this gift basket just in time for a family member's birthday and was notified two days after the purchase that the order was canceled.  Apparently, and I checked this later on igourmet.com, the gift basket was out of stock.  So, I decided to purchase this basket.  But, just in case, I checked igourmet.com first.  Well, after checking I saw that this basket is sold out too, but it's not noted here.  My relative's gift will be late now.  So, beware of ordering gifts from igourmet.com here.  The item may be sold out at igourmet and it might not be noted here at Amazon.  So, check igourmet's inventory first at their website, or just order from someone else.
