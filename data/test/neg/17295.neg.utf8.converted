I drink many types of teas, some hot and some cold. This tea claims to be "orange spice" but has NO TASTE AT ALL!!! I cut a tea bag open to examine the contents and I found NO SPICES, just black tea...This was a total waste of money. I will continue buying a different brand and this will go in the trash, literally!
