This box looks impressive, but it's very misleading. Items are really small. That's a 2 oz jar of olives, 4 oz. of Wisconsin processed cheese food (more like Velveeta than a true cheese), a 1.75 oz sweet hot mustard, 3 oz. of pretzels---and the big item is a 9 oz. summer sausage. The box was filled with LOTS of styrofoam peanuts and a little crinkled colored paper. For $39.99 on sale, it wasn't the really nice gift package I thought I was buying.
