This is my first time trying any of the National Foods coffees. First of all, be careful when you open the package. I peeled back the cover and powdery coffee went everywhere. Making the coffee is very easy - just put a few teaspoons (they recommend four) into a mug with hot water.<br /><br />I really loved the smell of this coffee. The pumpkin scent is great, and really makes you think of Fall. My problem was that it was really too rich to drink more than a couple sips. The coffee seemed very sweet, and didn't match the smell, meaning that the actual coffee didn't have that "bite" of pumpkin. I didn't find it very satisfying. However, a couple family members said it "wasn't too bad" and did manage to drink the whole thing. So I think a lot depends on your taste. Overall, it is a rich coffee that is best used for an occasional treat rather than as your regular morning beverage.
