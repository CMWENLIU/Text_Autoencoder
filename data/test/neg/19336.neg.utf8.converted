I just received this item and am very disappointed. The product is GREAT!  I am a cook and this is my favorite olive oil. However, I'm disappointed because it is completely overpriced here on Amazon. I usually buy @ Whole Foods for about $25/bottle and sometimes it's on sale for ~$20. AMZN's price is $31.50/bottle. GREAT product, just waaaaaaay to expensive here.
