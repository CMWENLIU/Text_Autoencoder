After trying this tea at a friend's house I was smitten, so I immediately went home and ordered from Amazon.  The written description clearly states that there are no artificial flavors in it, so imagine my disappointment when I received the tea which does indeed have artificial flavors in it!!  To Amazon's credit they refunded my money immediately (there are no returns in the grocery department).  However, I would have rather saved myself the hassle of placing the order at all had I know that it contained artificial flavors.
