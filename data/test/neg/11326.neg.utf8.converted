Before I give my review, I have to admit that I normally don't pay a lot of attention to 1 star reviews because I find that the person is usually angry about the item. I'm not angry, but I do regret my purchase.<br /><br />I ordered a case of these drinks during the holiday lightening deals a few weeks ago. I also had my husband order a case as one of the family gifts for my sisters and parents. We already opened our case, and it was the most vile drink I have ever tasted. It seemed spoiled, and I really couldn't even tell that it was supposed to taste like coconut water. When my son got home from school, he wanted to try one. I told him they weren't good, but he insisted. He took a drink and said it was okay, but I could tell that he didn't want to admit it wasn't good. He took a few more sips, and then said he didn't want it anymore. I'm so glad that I tasted one first because I had planned on putting them in his lunch bag. Now we're stuck with a case of these nasty things that I don't even want to give away to anyone.
