WARNING - UNRETURNABLE, STANDARD SIZE, NOT "LARGE"......In no way, shape, or form, are these LARGE baking cups. I read the 2.5 inch and dutifully measured the bottom circumference of my large muffin pans..., which were exactly 2.5 inches across the bottom. Imagine my surprise when these arrived and they were your standard size, been making them since I was a kid, cupcake liner. Then, what fun! I find out that I can't return them to get the right size. I now have a lifetime supply of cupcake liners that I will never use, and I have to make 1200 LARGE brownie muffins in less than two days.
