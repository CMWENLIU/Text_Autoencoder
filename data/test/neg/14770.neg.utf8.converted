Ok first off, these are the best tasting bars ever!  Here's the catch... they will give you the worst gas on earth.  Ok, so after having one, I got terrible gas, but eh, figured it could just be me... then the wife had one and went through the same nightmare, the gas lasted for like a full day and night straight.<br /><br />It's scary people, very scary.  We loved the taste but after trying a 2nd time and having the same results, we threw them out.
