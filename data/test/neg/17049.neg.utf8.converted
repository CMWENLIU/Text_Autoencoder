I was really looking forward to a salty savory crunchy break from the usual sweet protein shakes and  protein bars.  This one was lousy.  The chip is crunchy, salty and savory but the after taste is unbearable.<br /><br />Also, I should have read the fine print... these are not refundable.  I suggest that you should purchase one before buying an entire box.  My mistake, but after reading so many rave reviews I thought I'd like it.  Just goes to show you that everyone has different taste buds.
