I have been a longstanding and enthusiastic customer of Orgain for many years, subscribing to several cases per month.  I was quite dismayed to realize that they changed the formulation.  The change in taste was immediately obvious and it was NOT for the better.  I compared the old with the new list of ingredients and there are a number of changes.  I wish they hadn't messed with a good thing.  I practically lived on Orgain before and now I can barely choke it down.  It just doesn't taste good any more.  Yuck!!  I need to find an alternative!!
