Just to start with, I'm typically not the type to use Dove bodywash, though my fiancee is a huge fan of the female version.<br /><br />However, due to a pregnancy and the associated hypersensitivity to smells that come along with it, I had to give up my Old Spice Denali bodywash and went in search of an unscented one. My fiancee sent me to the store with "advice" to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.<br /><br />Turns out Dove unscented, isn't; at least, not exactly.<br /><br />We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the "unscented" label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn't too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.<br /><br />That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.<br /><br />After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn't have come across as a "heavy" odor in use, so...<br /><br />I don't know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that's just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn't work for our needs, so I'm back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap.
