This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.
