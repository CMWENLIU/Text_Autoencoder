The product image you see is an image of the 5 (FIVE) pound gummy bear. Not of the .5 (POINT FIVE) one.<br /><br />Also, in the description it says ".5 pound gummy bear". That's just deceptive. They know everyone's going to be looking for the 5 pound one, and thinking this is it, since that's a picture of the larger bear.<br /><br />Deceptive. Wrong. Uncool.<br /><br />Do not buy. (I've bought the 5 pound one. I easily recognize its dimensions. You're welcome.)
