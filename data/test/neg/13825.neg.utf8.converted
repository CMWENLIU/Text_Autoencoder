Been using Keurig K-Cups for quite a while and enjoy a good quality espresso as well as a strong cuppa every day. I like this Brand and give a few flavors a try every now and then, this flavor didn't meet its claims - it is indeed smooth but does not have the 'extra bold' flavor nor does it resemble espresso. I would classify this as mild at best (even with the smallest Keurig pull of 5oz.) I'd return it if I could, I have 45 of these that I can admire unused.  As a comparison, one of my favorite flavors is Green Mountain Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>
