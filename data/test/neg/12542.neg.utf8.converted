I am very depressed... I really, really liked this product, but apparently their manufacturing locale has changed. The product still has parve certifications but there is a new warning on the label that I only noticed after drinking some and becoming uncomfortably stuffy. So, for those who are allergic to anything, I advise avoiding what once was an enjoyable product.<br /><br />Contains: Soy. Produced in a facility that processes or handles milk, eggs, soybeans, tree nuts, what, fish and shellfish.<br /><br />... Seriously, -shellfish-?! Granted, it's the milk that is a personal problem for me, but who in the heck thought that moving the manufacturing locale to a place working with pretty much all of the major food allergens was a good idea?
