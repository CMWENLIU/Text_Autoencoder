This was under the wrong catagory and when arrived I found that it was chemical and not natural.  Chemical dyes are not good for you and causes a mulitude of problems when eaten no matter what the amount.  The service was fast on delivery though and the company was great at giving me credit for the return of product and the shipping charges.  I rated this item low because of the chemical content.  I know that when the FDA wanted to remove red 3 because it was proven to cause cancer tumors, the Republicans in office would not let them do it.  It is still in our system today.  One of the poisons that the FDA won't remove.  When I asked why.... I kid you not!  A retired FDA person told me it was to control population.  So how many other dyes are out there that are dangerous?  I am sure their are a lot along with the Aspartame group and others I know.
