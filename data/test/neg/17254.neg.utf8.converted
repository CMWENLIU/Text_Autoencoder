This tea was very inexpensive.  There is a reason for that.  The leaves contain stems and lots of them.  There is no puffed popcorn in it and it makes a weak liquor.  It will become bitter after steeping for more than 3 minutes.  I like the price and if the price is what you are after, go ahead and buy it.  But, if you have had some very good organic Gen mai cha, you will be disappointed.
