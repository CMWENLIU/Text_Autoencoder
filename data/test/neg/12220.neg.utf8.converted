here is the sole problem i have with buying things from amazon:<br /><br />They do not clearly list ingredients.<br /><br />I'm lactose intolerant, pretty severely in fact. Bought this starter to make vegan yogurt. Turns out the culture has skim milk, a fact clearly stated on the package but nowhere stated on the page.<br /><br />Thanks. This is now useless to me.
