Below is the review for regular white granulated sugar twin, i bought the brown at the same time, after making the cake i tasted the brown sugar and it had the same off taste.<br /><br />Ive been following the Atkins plan and have been trying various no calorie sweeteners trying to find my favorite. I made a cake with this and it was awful, i used 1 cup in the recipe for the whole cake, which i have done before with splenda. I tried Sugar twin because it is a lot cheaper. The whole cake was in-edible, it had a very sweet chemical like taste. even after adding frosting it was awful and left my stomach in knots. I recommend splenda or ez sweetz.<br /><br />Cheers!
