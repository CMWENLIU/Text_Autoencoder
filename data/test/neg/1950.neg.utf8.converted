I purchased organic Good Earth (at a "whole foods" type of store) but not in the packaging shown.  I was disappointed in the flavor because it just seemed as though it used to be so much immediately spicy and flavorful and sweet.  Then I saw this package in another store and purchased it.  When I tried it I found it was more like what I had been expecting.  I compared ingredients between the two boxes.  Lo and behold the tea in the package shown had "artificial flavor" as ingredient #3!!  Wow!  So that was the ingredient that made it so appealing.  I had never read the label on the old Good Earth that I was so "addicted" to!! Needless to say, I am just fine drinking the organic Good Earth with all natural ingredients.  So, guess that means I need to be a good label reader!
