This sweetener claims that a single packet will provide the same sweetness as two tsps. Wrong!! After 2 packets you just barely start to taste any sweetness. I had to use 4 packets to get my desired taste which is 2 tsps of (domino's) sugar in my  tea. In addition, Stevia is supposed to be 300 times sweeter than sugar cane aka table sugar. This particular brand does not even live up to its own advertisement of a single packet having the same sweetness as two tsps.<br /><br />Btw liquid stevia is much more potent and a few drops will do it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Sweetens without affecting your blood glucose levels...(as all stevia does)<br />-The after taste is very suttle...(no licorice)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Takes too many packets to sweeten<br />-Pretty expensive
