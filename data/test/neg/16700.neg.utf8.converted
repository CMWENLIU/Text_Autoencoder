I purchased these snacks because I had read they were healthy and the reviewers here said they tasted very good. I was excited when I got them and took them to work for part of my lunch the next day. They smelled very fishy when I opened the package but I thought perhaps they would taste good despite the smell. So not. These taste awful. They tasted like fish and not in a good way. I think this must be what the bottom of a river tastes like. I had several of my co-workers try them in case it was just my taste. They all told me they tasted terrible and were surprised that I had bought them. One girl even spit her bite out into a tissue. I do not recommend these.
