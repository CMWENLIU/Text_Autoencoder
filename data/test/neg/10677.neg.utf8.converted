I was disappointed when I bought these beans at the Harry Potter Expo.  The flavors have nothing to do with Harry Potter.  I don't mind extras, but the manufacturer should include all of the flavors written in the book.  A devoted Harry Potter fan will be looking for: chocolate, peppermint, spinach, liver, tripe, bogie/booger, pepper, vomit, toffee and earwax.  Previously, I enjoyed the beans including these authentic flavors, as well as other interesting ones that fit the theme such as grass and dirt.  Where did they go?  This set includes only one flavor from the book (pepper) and the rest seem completely out of touch with the theme.  While others may find these fun, I find no point in buying something as a fan when the item has nothing to do with the thing that I love.  I hope they bring the real beans back!
