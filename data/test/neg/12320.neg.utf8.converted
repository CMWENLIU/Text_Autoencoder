This is the very WORST coconut product I've ever used, I'd give it a NO STAR if I could......was excited when I found it in the health food store....organic, small size, great price & sounded great as a dairy replacement....NOT!<br /><br />It tastes like "soap"....no coconut flavor whatsoever...not even eatable....<br /><br />I bought 3 of these (and dislike being wasteful)...so will try to see if I can melt it down and see if I can use it as a hair conditioner...??
