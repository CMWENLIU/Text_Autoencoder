We purchased these Wolfgang Puck Coffee pods because Amazon has had Senseo pods out of stock for quite awhile.  We love our Senseo coffee maker but it's difficult to find the pods anywhere else (except from Senseo and they cost quite a bit more than the ones we purchased from Amazon).  We tried these Wolfgang coffee pucks but they're too thick to put 2 pods in at a time.  They come packaged one to an envelope and although we understand that the reason there is to make them seem "fresher" but it's a pain to have to cut up each envelope - not to mention a waste of paper.  The pods only produced about a 1/3 of a cup so we had to wait for the first one to finish brewing and then insert a new pod to make almost a full 8 ounces of coffee.  Even though the Senseo pods were packaged with a lot more pods into one package, they were still fresh and what's more important, we liked the coffee taste much better than the Wolfgang pucks. We will not be ordering the Wolfgang pucks again.
