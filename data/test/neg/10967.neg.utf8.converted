It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail. It looks great in the picture with the little pond and all but whether you keep this plant indoors at any temperature, it is doomed. Amazon is very nice when it comes to these plants. They usually are very nice when a plant passes away by crediting your credit card but it took so long to die that I just couldn't call them to ask for a credit because of the long period of time between the time I bought it and the time it died. Oh well, I'll write it off on my taxes or something like that.
