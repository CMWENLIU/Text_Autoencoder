they have a disclaimer on their package that it is packaged in same facility as nuts *and may contain* & it just sucks when you are dealing with food allergies & young children. There are so many foods they can't eat, now we have to eliminate all the CYA foods too, b/c you never know.<br /><br />Very disappointed with Sun Maid, their competition Ocean Spray does not pack their product in the same facility, so we are now only using ocean spray
