I love coffee. In the K-Cup world I'm not brand loyal. I used to frequent Gloria Jean's while growing up in So.Cal and like their icy sweet drinks before Coffee Bean or Starbucks had a comparable offering. Fast forward to today. In my honest opinion, this K-Cup tastes like dirty coffee warmed over. I wasn't expecting a cappuccino. I know what a Cappuccino is. I've been to France & Italy half a dozen times and fully enjoy espresso drinks while dining there. That said, what I was expecting was something that tasked vaguely like espresso perhaps or a full bodied roast. That is not what this delivers.
