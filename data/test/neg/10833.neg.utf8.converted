I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it's just a LIE.  A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  I don't even use SLS on my hands.  It's also heavily loaded with silcones, which laminates hair and weighs it down, so you need a shampoo to get it out.  You might want one conditioner or straightening product with cones, but not your shampoo.  Also, it contains other ingredients that causes allergic reactions, and does nothing for hair, (Bismuth Oxychloride).  Why would you want to stick Bismuth in a shampoo?  In short, steer clear of these products.
