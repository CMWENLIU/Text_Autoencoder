This quality product should be in a glass jar. Plastic is cheap and this product deserves better. The worst thing is, plastic containers can leach toxic chemicals into the food they hold. It appears that they are unwittingly sabotaging their own product.<br />Due to label info, the jar's shape and the "wrongness" of a plastic container, I had assumed the jar was glass. I won't buy it again.
