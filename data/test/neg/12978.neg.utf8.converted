I have already contacted the company that sells these and your company.  These dog chews are horrible!  I actually gagged when I opened the package.  They smell like rotten beef.  I didn't realize that they were made in another country either until I got them.  They are not fit to feed to a rat.  I am very upset about this and now trusting the companies you deal with.  You can see that I buy much from amazon, and have never complained before.  I believe I should be compensated for this terrible experience.
