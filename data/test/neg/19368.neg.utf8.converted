This thing is terrible. It takes forever to steam anything. Diced carrots took well over an hour. I thought the unit must be defective so i exchanged it for a new one. Same problem. It's just not a very powerful machine. The blend function is underpowered too. You have to keep pausing the blend to scrape down the bowl and move the contents around. What a hassle.It doesn't make the process of making food for baby any easier. After steaming you are expected to lift out the hot basket with dripping ,steaming veggie water, drain it over the sink, bring it back to the bowl and scrape it back in and then stand there while it (doesn't quite) blend. Making any food for my baby took forever and made such a mess that it just wasn't worth it. Cleaning it was also a real pain. After trying several other baby food makers I finally found the Baby Brezza. It's cheaper and it's awesome. One bowl. No parts. One button to steam then blend. I can push it and walk away . Lo and behold. It actually steams then blends! Fabulous. Skip the Beaba. It's all hype
