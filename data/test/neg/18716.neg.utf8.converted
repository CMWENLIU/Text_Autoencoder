Seriously, $14.99 for this super small jar. It's not gold! Do not buy this product, it's extremely over priced! Why is there no reference to the size of the jar on Amazon's web site? Ridiculous!<br />Wow, just found this product at Honey Baked Ham locally for $6.99. Can't tell you how horrible a deal this is. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON!!!!!
