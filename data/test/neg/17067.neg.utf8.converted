I bought and used this "raw syrup" only to find out isn't raw, natural, or a syrup. This is not like honey or maple syrup. It is processed and is a high fructose syrup. The only real difference between agave and high fructose corn syrup is the corn. Now, if that is what you are looking for this is the product for you. Granted, Agave is suppose to be organic; so it probably doesn't have chemicals and is non-GM however in my opinion this is not a health food. It is heavily refined. Do some research before you buy.
