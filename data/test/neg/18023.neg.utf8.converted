*Hot* Thai tea is a favorite of mine, but few Thai restaurants carry it because after boiling and preparing tea in a big pitcher, they keep it in the fridge to serve as the far more popular Thai ice tea. (Heating up some of it for hot-tea orders a. doesn't occur to some, b. doesn't produce good results.<br /><br />So I ordered Thai tea, hoping to provide the hot version for myself at home, but nowhere is this of the same flavor (faintly vanilla-ish) and strength as in a restaurant from a pot - and I tried various times of steeping it.
