So I purchased this and now feel so suckered.  I was thinking I must have been starving when I ordered this.  Don't be dare fooled by the pictures and the other reviews of this product.  I am almost certain that Hormel has their employees or pays employees to write good reviews on their product here.<br /><br />I am a dude that usually eats just about anything.  I'm taking this "food" to a shelter or something.  I have not fully decided yet because I'm not so sure I want to put the homeless folks through it.  That's how bad the stuff is.  The chemical taste in the food is noticeable and it's down right nasty.<br /><br />I can't believe  I was duped into buying this product.  Hopefully I can get at least some satisfaction of knowing that someone homeless got to eat something. I don't usually waste my time writing reviews.  However, sitting here feeling a bit sick to the stomach, I just had to.<br /><br />Simply put... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
