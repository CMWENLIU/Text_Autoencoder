I was looking into starting drinking loose tea and decided to go with Numi Tea Iron Goddess of Mercy.<br /><br />For the first few times I made tea - I enjoyed it - good taste, no bitterness and big whole leafs.<br /><br />The problem is that every few spoons I found a hair attached to one of the leafs. First I thought it might be mine, even though it didn't look like it. The second time I was puzzled. After the 3rd time - I poured a lot of it out on a plate and found LOTS of hairs! They are simply attached to the dried leaves.<br /><br />I am a clean freak and keep all food in clean cabinets. Tea package was sealed all the time with a clip. This hair made it all the way from the factory - where it somehow got to it during the drying process - where the leaves shrink to little balls.<br /><br />This tea ended up in the garbage and I'm back to tea bags.
