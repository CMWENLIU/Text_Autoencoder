recently i was diagnosed as having sensitivites to wheat, barley, etc.  i am also sensitive to corn.<br /><br />while i applaud ancient harvest for having this product, i think it is a misnomer to label it as gluten-free - since many people who have sensitivities to gluten products ALSO have sensitivites to corn.<br /><br />i did try this product earlier this year and had a problem with the 'corn' part.
