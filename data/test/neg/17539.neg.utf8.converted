I have been buying the Pantry Pest Trap for years, and they used to work very well, effectively luring moths with the provided lure and trapping them in liberally applied sticky adhesive that coated the entire surface of the inside of a well designed cardboard trap. The lure used to fit into a slot on the back of the trap, and the edges of the trap bent upward and in, to make it harder for moths to get back out. Well, a couple years ago they changed the lure to a little piece of pink rubber or plastic that you just dropped onto the sticky area. I immediately noticed that the lure wasn't NEARLY as effective as the old one was. Additionally, edges no longer bent upwards, and the sticky area inside the trap had shrunk significantly, so moths could escape more easily. I just bought a box a week ago, and I never will again.  While they have kept the box the same size, they have shrunk the sticky portion to such a small area, these things aren't going to catch much of anything. Of course, I guess that may be the point - since these won't hold many moths anymore, you'll have to replace them more often.  I'll be looking for an alternative, because they aren't worth wasting anymore money on.
