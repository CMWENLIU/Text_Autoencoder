Ordered these thinking that they would work with a Keurig, as Amazon recommended them while I was shopping for decaf K-cups. My mistake in believing that Amazon would send me to look at pods while I was shopping for K-cups. Of course they are non-returnable. Coffee "pod" descriptions should include a disclaimer that they are not K-cups or alternatively state which coffee makers the product will work with.
