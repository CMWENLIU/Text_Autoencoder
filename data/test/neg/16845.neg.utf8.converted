I have to admit, these K-Cups make an out of this world cup of coffee.  However, in my most recent shipment, I have had more than a dozen of these cups clog and send coffee grounds everywhere.  I am thoroughly displeased and am looking for Amazon, or Timothy's, to make it right.  The quality of the coffee is second to none, but the quality of the manufacturing in this last batch was horrible, thus the "2 stars."
