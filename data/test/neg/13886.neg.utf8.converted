The current description states "Healthy snack."  I agree that these are definitely delicious, but they are in no way healthy!  They contain 2.5g of Trans Fat!!! (The 2nd ingredient is Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil.  They also contain MSG, BHT, caramel color, and some other questionable ingredients.<br />The taste may be 4 or 5 stars, but the nutrition is negative 10!  At least they are honest with their labeling.  Most companies would reduce the serving size so that it came to less than 1/2g of trans fat per serving and slap a "trans-fat free*" label on the front to deceive the consumer.<br />I stumbled upon these while searching for organic ingredients to make my own "healthy" snack mix.  These used to be one of my favorite parts of the mix...so disappointed!!!
