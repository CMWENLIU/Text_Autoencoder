this is so unbelievably horrible!<br /><br />what it claims, the packaging, the wording, etc... anyone who makes a child drink this should be arrested for child abuse.<br />i know, kind of extreme... just trying to make a point.  I almost bought this because the price, sounds like a good deal.<br /><br />I decided to find out whats in it first.  sounds fairly easy, but noooooo.  good luck finding the ingredients.  kraft website??? nope!  here on amazon??? nope!  simply web search??? nope!<br />I found it on kmart of all sites.  they listed the ingredients, thanks kmart.<br /><br />#1 Water<br />#2 High Fructose Corn Syrup<br />#3 Citric Acid<br />#4 Sucrolose (aka splenda) which is made by taking sugar grown naturally, slicing out part of its dna, and adding in a molecule from bleach.  think GMO, and tastes like crap to boot.<br />#5 something called "Natural Flavor".  check it out from the FDA:<br />under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22)<br /><br />So basically we have no idea what that is.  but clearly it offers zero nutritional value<br /><br />So thank you Kraft and Capri sun for trying to sell me poisonous sugar water masked as health food for my children!
