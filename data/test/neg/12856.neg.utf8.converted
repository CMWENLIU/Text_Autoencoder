I was really disappointed by these cookies.  Yes, they are gluten and egg free but they're also somewhat tasteless other than sweet.  The chocolate was completely melted and they were delivered on a day when the temps were in the 70s.  I let them get to room temp but the chocolate never solidified again.  The texture was what I would expect; soft and a little grainy but not bad.  I would have liked more ginger in the taste and less sweet.  I was not able to find a nutrition label other than the ingredients.  If you cannot have gluten, eggs, etc., you might like these cookies as a treat once in a while but you'll want to get them from a local store so you might have a chance to eat them before they melt.  Overall, I was unimpressed.
