My fiancee and I have been testing out alternatives to regular milk. I like regular milk, but she does not (though this wasn't the only considered factor). We both enjoy soy milk and Whole Foods 365 almond milk. So we figured we would also like the Dream brand as well since we had a coupon. Regrettably, the Almond Dream milk is the worst milk I have ever tasted. Even regular milk that has gone a little off doesn't bother me, and milk that has certainly gone off still isn't this bad. I'm not a picky milk person. We are pouring the rest of this milk down the drain.<br /><br />I will consider the possibility that the milk we purchased is bad, in which case there is a quality control issue for what is a very expensive product. I'll pass on this brand in the future.
