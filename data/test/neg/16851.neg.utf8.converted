I have tried many of the caffenated and decaf K-cups.  Timothy's Columbian Decaf is the only one I don't like at all.  I think it tastes like instant coffee, which I won't drink.  I made the mistake of buying a box of 18 K-cups (without having tasted it in a sampler)and finally threw out the last half dozen K-cups because I just couldn't drink this coffee.  Among the decafs, my favorite is Green Mountain's French Roast Decaf. Among the caffenated ones, my favorites are Diedrich's French Roast, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Emeril's Extra Bold.
