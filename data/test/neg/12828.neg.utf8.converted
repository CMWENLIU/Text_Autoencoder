I try to buy organic when I can. These puffs received great reviews, and advertise their low sugar content. The "Greens" flavor made me think that... they will taste like greens! It seemed like a great find.<br /><br />Greens-<br />Well, there might be "greens" in these puffs but you sure can't taste any of it.<br /><br />What do they taste like?<br />They taste sweet- an outer coating of sweetness, followed by a rice puff flavor. I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are "just like Cheerios".<br /><br />Sugar content-<br />They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting.<br /><br />Packaging-<br />You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes. Each container contains 2.1 oz (60 g) of rice puffs. The containers are so light you could think they are empty. The packaging is complete overkill.<br /><br />No wonder babies may like these- they taste sweet!
