I purchased this product despite mixed reviews. I was enticed by the bulk offering, the price and that it is organic.  I acquired a liking for chai however the overwhelming spice to this chai is over the top for even me. I wish I could pinpoint exactly what's out of balance with the spices. Unfortunately, this will either be used in potpourri or discarded.<br />I would still be willing to try (one more time) other tea from this company.
