This might not be the healthiest snack in the world, but for a quick, somewhat tasty bite Kraft microwave macaroni and cheese is decent enough.<br /><br />On the plus side it is extremely easy and quick to make, although frankly the small portions are really on for a small side dish or a quick snack.<br /><br />The one thing I do not like about it is the cheese seems really hard to blend into the pasta and sometimes it clumps up instead of spreading evenly, which can make for a rather interesting culinary experience.<br /><br />While I don't eat these often, if I am feeling lazy and want a quick bite, this works well enough for me.
