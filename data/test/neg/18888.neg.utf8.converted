When we received our first shipment of Bergin Brazil Nuts in January, we were thrilled with the taste and freshness.  Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the order received in April.  These are quite rancid and ugly tasting.  We decided to give this product a 2 star rating rather than 1 because the first batch was so very tasty and there is always the chance that we might be lucky again, if we were willing to take the chance, although that is unlikely at this point.
