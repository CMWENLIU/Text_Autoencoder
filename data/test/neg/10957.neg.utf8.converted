I originally rated this product with only one star because I didn't like it at all when I drank it.  However, I have come back to revise my review after sharing it with other members of my family.  They absolutely loved it and were fighting not to drink all the cans at one sitting!  After one adult and three children (aged 9-15) said it tasted very good, I decided it was just me who didn't like the taste.  Unfortunately I can't seem to change the number of stars I gave it, but if I could, I would give it five because I was definitely over-ruled in my opinion of the flavor.  Don't go by what I say; go by what my family says. :-)
