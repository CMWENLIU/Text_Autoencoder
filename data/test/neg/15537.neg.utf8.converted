If you love the taste of sucralose then this is the hot cocoa for you. It is lower calorie as it does not have near the sugar of normal hot cocoa, but you can taste the difference big time. I will not purchase this item again as I dislike the fake taste. If you are addicted to hot cocoa, but want to cut out the calories then this might be a good product for you. Consider it like going from coke/pepsi to diet coke/diet pepsi. It's a doable product (hence the two stars instead of one) but it isn't doable for me. I have hot cocoa not so often and I want it to taste good. Just for your information I thought Dark Chocolate was the best, but that not fair since I will almost always favor that. Next would be the milk chocolate and then the peppermint. The peppermint could be better, but I think it tasted the most off with the sugalose.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Less calories<br />+Variety of flavors<br />+Great Amazon price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Artificial sweetener taste
