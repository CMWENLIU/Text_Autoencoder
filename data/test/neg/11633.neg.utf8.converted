I really wish these pill pockets would work. Instead, I have tried every flavor (including the dog ones just in case) and I have followed every tip I could find online religiously.<br /><br />For instance, I take great care at handling the pills with the opposite hand as the one handling the pockets. I tried giving it to them alone, without pill just to see if they liked them. I have tried mixing them with treats they do like. Invariably all my 5 cats refuse to eat these pill pockets snacks. It makes me wonder if the manufacturer even ever tried giving them to a cat.<br /><br />It's really too bad because I have one kitty, one I am incredibly attached to, that is dying of hearth disease. I have to give him numerous pills every day. I have tried everything and I really hoped these treats would do the trick. Instead, what I am doing now is to take my Dremel tool and hollow out the cat treats he likes so I can put the medicine inside. It's painstaking work. The sad thing is that if I use this product even just as "mortar" to keep the other cat treat together, he is able to sniff it and won't eat it. I tried skipping the meds and it's not that. It's the pillpocket that doesn't work.<br /><br />Considering that 5 out of 5 cats do not like this pillpocket in my experience, I cannot really recommend them.
