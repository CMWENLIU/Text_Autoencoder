The idea of a popcorn bag that turns into a bowl is simply brilliant! I was sick of having to either get my hands covered with grease or clean the large bowl I'd dump my popcorn into. So I got these as soon as I saw them in the grocery store. Here are the problems;<br />What's worse than a hot, oily paper bag? Very hot, oily PLASTIC. The plastic absorbs heat more than paper, and it's the part you're expected to pull off to get to the popcorn! Ouch! Burnt my fingers more than once, and when I didn't, had to wait and let it get cold-ish.<br />The bowl is made of the same paper as the bag, and more flimsy, so you don't avoid getting grease everywhere. Unlike the bag, the bowl does not contain the popcorn. The popcorn reaches the very top of the bowl and falls out.<br /> I'm going back to bags.
