My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous.
