I have wanted a Keurig coffee maker for over a year.  I purchased one for Christmas and bought a package of Cafe Escapes Mocha and Cafe Escapes cocoa for under the tree.  Both are watery disappointments...mere instant coffee/cocoa.  I might as well buy a box of cocoa or a tin of International Coffee and heat up some water.  What a waste of money.  Not the coffee maker, the product.
