I used to enjoy gluten-free carob chips as a kid, and I was sad that there weren't any on the market as an adult. The chips I remembered tasted great straight out of the bag. I was happy when I heard that Chatfield's Carob Chips were now NOT made with icky barley malt, and were dairy free. They aren't available anywhere in my area, so I ordered in bulk from Amazon. When they arrived, I ripped open a bag- and found them so sickeningly sweet I could hardly eat them. They honestly taste more like white chocolate than carob. Seriously, Chatfield, did you taste these before mass producing them? I can only hope they taste better baked into recipes.
