There is nothing Extra Bold about this coffee.  I was disappointed when I tasted this.  Little flavor or aroma.  Not what I would expect out of a coffee called espresso.  I have tried it in various sizes from the 5.5 oz to 12 oz. not much of a difference.  If you are looking for a Dark Roasted full bodied coffee - look elsewhere.
