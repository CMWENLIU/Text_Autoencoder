None of three bags of walnut is fresh.  When I opened the bag, unpleasant odor came out.  I opened three all, none of them was edible. It contains strong, out-of-dated smell.  I could not find the expiration date on the bag. This produce totally wastes of money.  Keep away from this product. I would choose 0 star if I could. This is the worst experience I ever have in Amazon.  I got to throw all of them away!
