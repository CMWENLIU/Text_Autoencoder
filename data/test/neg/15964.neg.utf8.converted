I love my Keurig and I was ecstatic about the hot cocoa option. My Keurig came with this flavor as part of the variety pack, and I have to say, it was probably the worst hot cocoa I have ever had. Hardly any taste. Pretty much tasted like very watered-down hot chocolate.<br /><br />The only question I have now is whether there are other brands that make a good Keurig hot cocoa, or if the concept of hot cocoa in a k-cup is one that just doesn't work.
