These are SO cute.  I really wanted this to work with my new potato bag from Orka.  BUT the first time that I tried to stick it to something (without anything even hanging from it), it fell off, hit the floor, and the cheap plastic hook broke off.  The hook looks as if its metal, but its just silver colored plastic.<br /><br />I ordered 2 of these, and sent them right back immediately.
