their New Recipe for 70% is totally atrocious and horrible.<br />It's greasy, cheap tasting with soy lecithin  "to aid the chocolate flowing and molding properly" according the their QA.<br />I don't buy it because their other bars are just fine without soy. Keep in mind that the lecithin is most likely derived from GM soy.<br />Many people are allergic to soy - they don't care!<br />Shame on Lindt! I'm glad others hate it too, maybe they will get a message.<br />You may just as well buy cheaper brand from the candy machine.
