This chai has all the flavors that traditionally belong in a good chai, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, etc. Then there's the overpowering flavor of maple so strong that you could sweeten it and pour it over pancakes!<br /><br />This stuff is foul and I'm very glad it was so inexpensive, although twelve bucks for a pound of garbage really isn't that inexpensive when you think about it.<br /><br />Anyway... it's a sixteen ounce package of nasty and I wish I could get my money back on it. Lesson learned.
