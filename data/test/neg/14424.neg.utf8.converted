Each bag I've received has gotten drier and less appealing.  The last bag I received was mostly crunchy, so after a call to Navitas, they sent me a replacement of another item.  I've been ordering another brand that is pesticide free and about as juicy as rasins - I love them!  I still love Navitas' chocolate products.
