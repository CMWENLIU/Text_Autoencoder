My kids have been drinking this milk for years. My older son is essentially a vegetarian, and we have relied on this milk for a big percentage of his daily protein and calcium. He is also a very picky eater, so he noticed immediately the change to low-fat. I know, it has less sugar, but that's a deal-breaker for him. We're willing to let him have that extra sugar, if that's the price we have to pay for him to get his protein. Needless to say, we will be looking for a different brand.<br />BTW, I know I'm not alone. I started buying this milk on Amazon because it would sell out at all the stores in the city I live. Now there's a glut of the new low-fat milk at all the stores.
