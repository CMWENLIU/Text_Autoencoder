I purchased these m&m's for a baby shower and was excited to find ones that were hot pink.  While they arrived quickly, I was so disappointed to open them the day of the shower to find that they were stale.  They tasted weird and the coating kept breaking off the candy.  I was not pleased with this purchase and would make sure not to purchase anything else from this seller.
