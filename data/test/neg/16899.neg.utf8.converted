My intended purpose for this marzipan was to enjoy plain or chocolate dipped.  My first impression when tasting this product was that it is too sweet.  The almond flavor is there, but is secondary to the sweetener.  This is a cake decorating or cooking marzipan, which it appears from the packaging is actually the intended purpose.
