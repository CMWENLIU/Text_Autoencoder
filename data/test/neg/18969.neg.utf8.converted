this is the first thing i have every bought at amazon that i was not only disappointed but embarrassed.  it was a gift for my childrens' anniversary.  the package was not at all like the photo. the items were flat down in the basket.  most boxes contained one or two items.  it was uninteresting.  the convenience of buying at amazon was a mistake this time.  i saw much more beautiful and less expensive baskets at other stores like costco.  anyway many other items i've purchased from amazon have been totally satisfactory.
