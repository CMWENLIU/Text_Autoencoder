One of my cats weft through a negative personality change, so my vet put him on medication as well as recommended this product.  I have a pet fountain, not a water bowl, and I had used the human variety of Rescue Remedy in my pets' fountain before buying this one.  The human formulation caused no problems.  However, when I switched to the pet formulation, the results were disgusting.  I had cleaned the fountain thoroughly, motor and all, as well as placing a new filter inside it when I made the change between the two formulations: after a week I noticed what looked at first like some type of dirt around the rim, so I took it apart to clean it.  Once I took it apart it looked like it had never been cleaned! The filter was obviously new, but COVERED BY MOLD!  There was mold everywhere!  When I took the motor apart again, it looked like it had never been done!  EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE FOUNTAIN WAS FULL OF MOLD TO SOME DEGREE!  IT MAKES ME ILL TO THINK THAT MY PETS WERE DRINKING FROM IT IN THAT CONDITION!  IF YOU HAVE A PET FOUNTAIN, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT: USE THE HUMAN VARIETY!!
