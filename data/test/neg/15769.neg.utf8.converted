I feel like I am taking crazy pills when I read the other reviews on these.  I did not like them at all.  To me they taste like a chewy brown-flavored center coated in sweet white wax.  The coating melts at anything above 60 degrees, so prepare to get fingers smeared if you open one from your purse.<br /><br />I was super bummed they didn't taste better, the nutritionals are decent and no sugar -- 2 stars and not 1 for that.<br /><br />I also discovered that I am one of those people who experience "gastric distress" from Malitol...30 minutes after I ate one before going grocery shopping.  They say, "never shop hungry," I advise never go ANYWHERE after you eat one of these before you know how your body will react. Delightful.<br /><br />Bummer for me, hope they work better for you :D
