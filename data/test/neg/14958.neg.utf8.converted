I really loved my first order and ordered for all my family members out of my area at Christmas.  I decided that my birthday would be perfect with my only gift coming from Shatila Foods to myself.  This Mixed Phillo Pastries order was a ghastly surprise.  By the time the order did get to me, the summer heat had done damage to the order.  Most all the anticipated gooey was all over the carton and had seeped out of the plastic and had absorbed all over and into the boxes.  I had a big mess on my hands with bubble wrap and all coated in sticky goo and the product was not as pictured 100%.  There were a couple of strange rice thread like crunchy types a row of brown and a row of white.  The brown tasted like soap.  The white didn't taste.  the first row were tiny samples of what is pictured and most of them were broken and very dry.  The baklava was OK but not sweet.  The rest were really dry and some tasted like they were over baked and burnt.  The whole box was a disappointment and I couldn't even share it with neighbors for my Birthday.  It was an embarrasement.  Not the quality I was spoiled with my previous orders.  I will not be ordering in the summertime months again if the plastic wrap won't hold the product inside the tray.  The inside of the shipping carton was even saturated.  I emailed Shatila as soon as it arrived then again 2 weeks later without acknowlegement or response.  :(
