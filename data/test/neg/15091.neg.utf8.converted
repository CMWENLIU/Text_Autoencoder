I know, it's not wasabi and it's not supposed to be. I get that.<br /><br />However this tastes LITERALLY like horseradish mixed with mayo. There are wasabi alternatives that actually taste somewhat  close to natural wasabi. This stuff is horrible, I picked some up today at Kroger's and am thinking about taking it back (I've never done that before in my life).
