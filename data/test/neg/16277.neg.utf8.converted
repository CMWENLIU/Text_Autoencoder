Yes, Ortho Max kills bugs.  I used it once without any problems, and the leaf-hoppers, flea beetles, and mosquitoes disappeared from our yard for over a week.  But the second time I attached it to the hose, and began spraying, the red open-and-shut valve on the top of the unit popped off as water was squirting through the hose, and into the container of insecticide.  This caused the mixture to geyser upward and hit me in the face, instead of spraying out of the nozzle.<br /><br />I immediately went inside and showered and washed out my mouth (yes, my mouth happened to be open when the valve popped off).  The container was only about a quarter full of insecticide when the valve popped off, so maybe I lucked out.  At least, I didn't drop dead, immediately.  However, I strongly recommend that you don't purchase this product.  It's way too dangerous to use.
