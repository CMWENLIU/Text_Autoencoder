I contacted Lil' Critters customer service several times to request that they provide test results for the mercury levels in their Omega-3 supplements.  With some relatively recent news suggesting that actual levels were higher than those reported for some manufacturers, I was concerned about what amounts my kids were ingesting.<br /><br />My initial request for information was responded to with someone in their customer service organization named Hollie who essentially said the same thing their website does - that these are tested very carefully and that they are safe.  I requested that she forward the test results.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I waited a couple of weeks and asked again.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />I asked again, indicating I wanted to continue purchasing these items from Costco if I was satisfied with the results and that I did not want to post my concerns in a public forum.<br /><br />No response.<br /><br />Given they are marketing these items for consumption by young kids at an age where their bodies and brains are so dependent upon proper nutrition, I would think a manufacturer with faith in their products would respond to a customer request pretty promptly.<br /><br />They haven't.  So I will be switching to another manufacturer who is a little more transparent with their product information.<br /><br />Update on August 9, 2010<br /><br />For those of you who have read the post that these gummy bears only contain plant-based ingredients, please check the container for yourself.  On the one I have, it says in bold italics underneath the ingredients list that the product DOES CONTAIN FISH!  Specifically, the product contains anchovy, sardine, mackerel and tuna.<br /><br />Note that the Environmental Defense Fund has a list [...] which outlines their recommendations for the maximum number of servings of various fish species that kids should have per month.<br /><br />Mackerel and tuna are on this list and are almost unsafe at any consumption level.<br /><br />In my view, this product should not be trusted unless the company provides testing results, and as far as I can tell, they have not done that.<br /><br />Update on August 15, 2010<br /><br />I just received my first shipment of Nordic Naturals Omega-3 Gummies, and my kids love them.  No fishy taste whatsoever!  They test their products vigorously and meet more stringent European standards for contaminant levels.  Yes, they are more expensive, but having the peace of mind of a better product is worth the expense.  Check them out.
