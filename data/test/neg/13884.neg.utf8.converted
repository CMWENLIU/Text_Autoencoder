This picker will get the fruit, but it usually gets some of the branch as well and sometimes rips off a whole branch. It pulls the fruit off. If the fruit does not come off easily, which my oranges usually don't, I have to pull hard. When the fruit finally comes loose, the back snap of the branch sometimes causes other oranges to fall to the ground and get bruised or broken. The wire hooks can damage the fruit unless you are very careful.<br /><br />The wire basket can be difficult to thread through the branches. It is also difficult to grab a single fruit in a cluster.<br /><br />Get the TwisterPicker also available here on Amazon. It beats the wire basket hands down. Read the reviews there before you buy here. Here's the link:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBCUD8">Fruit Picker, the TwisterPicker</a>
