Pros:<br />*tasty applesauce (3 oz)<br />*hearty multi-seed crackers (.5 oz, only about 7 crackers in a small bag)<br />*just OK organic chocolate square (.43 oz, two bites worth)<br />*convenient folding spork for eating<br />*easy to carry box of food<br /><br />Cons:<br />*slimy tuna with lackluster flavor (1.6 oz, enough for all the crackers), the tuna lacked any body and was unlike any tuna spread that I've made at home, the texture was super-smooth and didn't have any nice chucks or pieces of tuna<br />*bland fruit & nut mix (.75 oz), tasted like plain (unsalted) peanuts with just a few raisins and almonds, it was so dry and flavorless I couldn't even finish the bag and gave it to the squirrels outside<br /><br />**I wouldn't purchase this tuna meal again, but their hummus and crackers picnic box is so tasty and fulfilling I purchased multi-packs of the product!
