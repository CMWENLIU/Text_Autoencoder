I love this stuff...I eat about a bag a week of it. Healthy and nutritious...Quinoa is a gluten-free complete protein. OVERPRICED, though. I get it at Whole Foods for $6.99. $7.99 at New Seasons (Portland, OR) but they offer a 15% discount for a case, which makes it $6.79 a bag as opposed to $7.15 per bag, case price, on Amazon.<br />Not a huge difference, but what burns me is that Amazon says the regular price is $55.80 a case, which is $9.30 a bag--30% above RETAIL!<br /><br />A while back they were selling this for a discounted price you would expect on Amazon...something like $25 a case. That was a great deal. I should have bought a truckload then.
