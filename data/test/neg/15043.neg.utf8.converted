This honey simply did nothing to elevate the esophageal/acid issues which others here have claimed to have resolved by using the product.  Yes, I took it regularly, as directed, for two weeks.  Not in the least better.  The issue is not the taste, which is actually pretty good, but its efficacy.  It's a sham.
