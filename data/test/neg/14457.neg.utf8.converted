I got these for my sister, she loved them, although when she got them they were somewhat melted.. If you like Reeses then this is your dream...lol. I personally boycott all Hershey products due to their production of candy in Mexico. If Hershey cared more about American jobs I would rate the it five stars. I feel all processed food from Mexico questionable...lead content and such.
