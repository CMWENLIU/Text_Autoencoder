After viewing numerous ads concerning it being a healthy spread I bought one. It taste like chocolate frosting the hazelnut taste is lost. Also sugar is listed as the main ingredient, first one on the list, 21 grams per serving. Hazelnut should have been the main ingredient. I would not feel comfortable using it as a substitute for other nut butters or giving it to anyone for breakfast - spreading a cake with it, yes.
