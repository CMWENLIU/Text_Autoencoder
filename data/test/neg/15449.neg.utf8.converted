I would never purchase this product again. The only reason why it is purchased by many to begin with is because the nutrition facts are not posted online, and the product is ridiculously cheap. However, this product is loaded with trans fat: in all but a few, the total trans fat content in one pack is over the American Heart Association's recommended limit (2g daily). This product is also loaded with saturated fat (also bad).
