This package contains some foam seed holders, a few plastic cup sections to hold them, and some clear "caps" for the seed pods. Also, there are about a dozen blank circular papers to stick on the seed pods to identify your crop type. That's it!<br /><br />Re-use the original pod components and stay away from this item. $39.00 for $2.00 worth of plastic, paper, and foam.
