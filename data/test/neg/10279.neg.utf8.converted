What ever happened to the bubble gum of old? If you expect to find it here, you will be disappointed.<br />Bubble gum used to be a penny a piece. The penny piece was also a decent sized piece.<br />Now, the price has jumped and the size did shrink. This is not the same Dubble Bubble gum any more.<br />The flavor is nice, for a few seconds. Then, nothing. The pieces are also too small to blow bubbles. You need to chew two to three pieces to get a decent bubble.<br />Maybe I should look for Bazooka Joe? (Or is he too, just a distant memory?)
