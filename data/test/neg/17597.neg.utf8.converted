This is the first time a product has been so bad, I actually took a photo of the microwaved result so I could show my friends. The noodles looked like bloated invertebrates, and the color of the microwaved concoction prior to stirring drew the word "burned" to my brain. After stirring, it looked like a dull brown color, perhaps a weak gravy sauce rather than the reddish-toned sauce one usually sees when this dish is properly prepared, and not even the peanuts could liven up the sad tone and posture of the dish. I wondered where the food came from that was photographed for the box cover - it certainly was nothing like what came inside the box. Looking at the results, I had NO desire at all to taste it, but knowing I would probably post a review somewhere, I dutifully chewed on a spoonful.<br /><br />I've had decent-tasting items from this company before, so I hoped the taste would not reflect the awful appearance of the food. Sad to say, it tasted even worse than it looked. There was no real flavor to speak of, and something in me felt uneasy about the idea of consuming any more of the stuff. I am not one to waste food ever, but I felt no remorse on throwing this product away because it really didn't fit my idea of "food". My one regret is I can't remember which local store victimized me by selling it to me, or I would have taken the entire thing back and demanded a refund.
