I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.
