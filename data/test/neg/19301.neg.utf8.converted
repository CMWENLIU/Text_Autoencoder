Shame on me for not looking at the other reviews from Starwest Botanicals Organic Products, where many customers are dissatisfied about the fact that the product comes from China.  It is "certified" organic by the Chinese, which as we all know means that it is certified to be made from fertilizer and small animal parts just like the milk they feed their children.<br /><br />Not worth the trouble to return - I will be dumping this in the trash and hoping that any resident rodent population partakes in the leavings.
