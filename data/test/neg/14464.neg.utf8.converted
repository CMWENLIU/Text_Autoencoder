CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm is not for me. I was extremely satisfied with the Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost shampoo I received. I thought I would give the Clear Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm a try. I am really sorry that I did. The product has no directions for using it and it was entirely too greasy for me. If it is made for African American hair, the label should say so.  I do not recommend this to anyone.
