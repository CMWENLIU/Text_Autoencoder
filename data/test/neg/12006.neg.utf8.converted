WARNING MEMBERS~~~~<br /><br />This item is NO LONGER MADE by Starbucks for Tassimo Machines.  This item is now PRICED AT OVER $7.00 PER T-DISK!!!!<br /><br />This is a VERY SAD SITUATION, as this STARBUCKS T-Disk was my 89 Year Old Mother's favorite item for her Tassimo Coffee Maker.  She tried the Nobu brand, and found it very weak and not as robust and flavorable.<br /><br />TASSIMO HAS BEEN DELT A FATAL BLOW BY STARBUCKS!
