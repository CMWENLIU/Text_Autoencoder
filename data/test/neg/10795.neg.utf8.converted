I'm absolutely in love with my Tanqueray & Tonics; I drink them at least once a week and was looking for a way to improve what seemed insurmountable with a better tonic water. Usually, I stick with Seagrams (and have even gone with Diet a few times). I purchased this case of Q Tonic thinking it would mix the low-calorie of diet tonic with the rich taste of non-diet tonic. I was wrong! After having numerous picky drinkers give Q tonic a taste, we've all come to the same conclusion: it tastes eerily similar to seltzer water. Have you ever been to a bar and ordered something with tonic only to find that they were out and substituted seltzer instead--it's no fun! Well, picture spending $45 dollars on a case of fancily bottled seltzer and mixing that with your favorite drink!<br /><br />So, in conclusion: if you like the fancy bottles and the lower calorie seltzer water tasting tonic, this is the tonic you want. If you enjoy the distinction of actual tonic versus seltzer, stay away from Q Tonic.
