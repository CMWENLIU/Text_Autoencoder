From the name, I was expecting a mocha flavor.  I ordered the two boxes of this as well as the variety pack.  Every flavor in the variety pack is better than the Mudslide.  It is a very bitter coffee.  Milk or creamer helps, but this is a disappointing flavor and it's taking me a long time to get rid of all 50 K-cups.
