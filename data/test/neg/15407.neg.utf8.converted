i love the cheese.  it was sent cold packed and arrived in great condition.  i do have<br />one problem.  I ordered 2 of the same product.  the company charged me 2 shipping fees.<br />I have not experienced this before.  i called the company and they credited me with<br />1 shipping fee right away.  apparently this is an amazon rule.  this rule needs to be<br />changed.  so, the company is great and amazon needs to review shipping fees.<br /><br />thanks - ann d.
