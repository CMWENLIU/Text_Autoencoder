I ordered Chocolate from Italy.  Maybe this was the first mistake since it is Texas in the Summer.  Anyway I took a chance because this is suppose to be the best chocolate in the world; according to another website.  Anyway the chocolate arrived at my door when I was not there.<br />So fedex in all its wisdom drove around with it all day and tried again when I was not there.  I had to go to the fed ex office and pick it up.<br />When I opened the box of course the chocolate was soup and the remains of a soggy single ice pack.  What does this say about this company?<br />They ship from Italy with one tiny ice pack; not even dry ice.<br />Also they said it was my fault that I was not home when Fed ex tried to deliver the package.  So I am out $75 and nothing to show for it.<br />Please send a message to this company that their chocolate is not all it is cracked up to be.
