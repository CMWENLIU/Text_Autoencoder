I ordered the 50's Gift Basket for my parents.  I ordered it a couple of weeks before Christmas and the package did arrive.  However, when I asked my Mom how she liked it, she told me that there were a few items missing.  The packing slip had listed what all should be in there, and the following were NOT there: charms assorted squares,smoothie peanut butter cup, cherry mash, chocolate cigarettes, walnettos.<br /><br />I sent an email to Hometown Favorites on 12/17/07 telling them that these items were missing and requested they satisfy my order.  As of today, 1/2/08 I have not heard back from them.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will NOT purchase anything further from their company...and would suggest you do the same!
