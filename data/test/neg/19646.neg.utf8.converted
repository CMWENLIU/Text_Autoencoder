I started feeding my 17-year-old cat Weruva a little over a year ago when she got bored with her old food. She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling "Give it to me NOW" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br /><br />Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br /><br />A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br /><br />Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet. But given the whole timeline, I simply cannot believe Weruva wasn't the biggest factor.<br /><br />Weruva because weluvya? Don't think so!
