I guess I should have paid more attention and read reviews from other "candy cigarettes".  There are about 16 "sticks" per pack and they are white hard candy slivers.  (and they have that chalky valentine's day "I love you" heart candy taste.)  There is no wrapping or smoke puff.  I now realize what I was looking for was "bubble gum cigarettes" not "candy cigarettes". Hope this makes sure no one else makes my mistake.
