After searching for the old Sunshine raisin cookies and reading the other reviews of these biscuits, I decided to try them.  Make no mistake -- these are NOT like the Sunshine cookies.  These are dry, crunchy biscuits (no, they weren't stale, they're just crunchy), with a few raisins thrown in for good measure. Many bites have no raisins at all - just a plain, neutral-tasting biscuit.  I don't remember the Sunshine cookies being crunchy, so that was also a disappointment.  Also, $15.00 is a lot of money to spend on a tin of biscuits this size.  I couldn't find these in the Asian market near me, but that's the way to go if you want to try these out (way cheaper).  If you're looking for something similar to the sadly-discontinued Sunshine raisin cookies, this isn't it. Try Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits - they're made with currants, but they're much closer to the original.
