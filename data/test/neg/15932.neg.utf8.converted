I purchased a bottle of the Sweetleaf Liquid Stevia English Toffee now they are offering a packet of two bottles. If you haven't tried this product before go for one bottle first. Yes, it's true ..  it is sweet with just a few drops. I don't know about the other flavors, however English Toffee tastes NOTHING like you would hope it would if you are a English Toffee lover. Besides ruining a perfectly good cup of coffee, this product has a somewhat bitter after taste. I would NOT recommend that any of my friends buy this, I'd offer mine to them. They will probably return it to me. YUCK!!!! I gave this product ONE star for ME for trying this stuff.
