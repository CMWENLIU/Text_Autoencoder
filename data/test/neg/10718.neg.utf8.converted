I couldn't believe the price on this tea, especially for lapsang souchong, my favorite black tea.  I read the other reviews on it and decided to give it a try.  My mistake; I now have a "ton" of tea (2 lbs) that, to my taste, has almost none of the l.s. smokey character.  If you want the distinctive smokey, almost peat-like flavor of l.s., don't bother with this one.  With some sugar, it was slightly reminiscent of l.s. (the only reason for my 2-stars instead of 1), so I guess I haven't totally wasted my money.  Honestly, I'm not even sure someone who only wants to sample the lightest l.s. flavor would feel rewarded with this brand (Coffee Bean Direct).  I won't buy it again, needless to say.
