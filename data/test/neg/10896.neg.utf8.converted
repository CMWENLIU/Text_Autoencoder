I love Good Earth Original, Sweet & Spicy and buy it by the case. When I ran low and wanted to order more, I saw that there was this organic version - so I bought a case of this instead.  I thought it would be the same taste - just organic - right?  Wrong! It is not anywhere near as good. It's not as sweet or spicy, in fact it's pretty tasteless.  I'm very disappointed and now I have boxes of this stuff! Damn!
