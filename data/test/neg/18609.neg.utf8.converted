I guess I was looking for steak and cheese spring rolls but these did not have any cheese flavoring.  Instead, they applied this awful sauce that ruined the whole roll.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was tender and delicious but as a complete package....goodness that sauce ruined the whole taste experience.  I won't be buying this particular product ever again but you may like the taste of this sauce so....give it a try once, like I did!
