I received a cactus "stick" a little over six inches in height.  It is in the process of being rooted.  They advertised "one gal plant. Blooming, fruiting size."  This is completely false.  There is nothing blooming, and this is not "fruiting size."  I know, because I have a collection of these cacti.  The "stick" has no branches or segments on it.  The "one gal" was a plastic pot, one-third filled with dirt with the "stick" shoved down into it, the rest was empty and was totally unnecessary but was presumably used to help drive up the cost of shipping and handling.  They are claiming that the current price is marked down from $49.99 suggesting a great deal of savings.  That, too, is an outrageous claim.
