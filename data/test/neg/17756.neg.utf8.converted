I purchased this item in addition to the actual trap by reading the reviews posted here on Amazon. The users must have had a much larger flea infestation than I as it took over a week to get 20 fleas. I used the trap in the area that the dogs sleep with no other light than the one on the trap. I know the dogs had fleas as I could see them. Maybe the fleas were smarter than the trap.
