The concept of these bars seemed pretty cool - 95% organic, live food, etc.  The fat in them is "good fat" so that's really not anything to worry about.<br /><br />The with the flavor I tried (Cashew and Agave Nectar) tasted HORRIBLE though.  To get an idea, imagine an old smelly shoe, rotted meat, and seaweed all mixed together and coated in grease.  That's what these tasted like.<br /><br />Amazon sometimes posts reviews of "similar items", so you might see this on a review for another flavor, whhich this doesn't apply to.  This revieww is only for the cashew/agave nectar.
