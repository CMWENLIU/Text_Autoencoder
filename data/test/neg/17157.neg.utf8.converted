Did not enjoy the taste, texture or density of the product.  Tried to toast it hoping to remove some of the moisture but not to be.  Our two slice toaster only toasts bread and made no progress towards drying this stuff.<br /><br />Of course this is a no return product, so it's still here. We tried to give a pack to the neighbors but made the mistake of letting them see it before getting it out the door.  We may throw some out in the yard to see if the wild animals will eat it. Hope the SPCA thinks it's a good food for them.<br /><br />Our lesson... buy books from Amazon and food from the grocery store
