I received one pouch of the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate daily booster from the Vine Program. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />It's touted to be an energy booster and full of electrolytes, but each packet contains 20 calories and 4 grams of sugar (print is so small I'm reading with a magnifying glass). Each packet contains 100% of your daily needs of chromium, copper and zinc, and 143% of your daily requirement of selenium. The EBOOST blend contains 340mg of Acai fruit and green tea extract. No mention of pomegranate.<br /><br />To use: Snip the end off the pouch and pour contents into a glass with 8 ounces of water. It's supposed to fizz, however, my packet did little of that. I am not a fan of colored beverages and the bright pink color was a bit of a turn-off as it looked artificial, though the packet says it's from beets.<br /><br />It did not have a pomegranate taste, but it also was not a pleasant taste. It seemed as though it was flavored to hide the vitamin taste, and didn't quite succeed.  Also, it comes with a warning for anyone taking prescription drugs or with a history of high blood pressure, heart problems or pregnancy, which certainly doesn't sound like a health drink to me. At $1.17 per pouch, it is pricey. I feel there are far better alternatives on the market.<br /><br />I was not impressed.
