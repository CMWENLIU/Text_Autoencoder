Godiva chocolates used to be la creme de la creme years ago, but they don't seem that good anymore. They're also outrageously expensive for the lighter, smaller amount you now get, just 7.2 oz. instead of 1 lb. The creme fillings in the 19 Belgian chocolates pack aren't very substantial compared to the chocolate shell and alot of the chocolates are just solids. The filling flavors aren't as good as I remember them and there isn't much variety. There are so many more choices in fine chocolate now than a few decades ago, somehow Godiva has lost ground.
