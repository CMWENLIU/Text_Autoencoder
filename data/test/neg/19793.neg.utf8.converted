This is the second bonzai tree that I received and just like the 1st one, this one does not look like it's going to make it for very long.  I thought maybe it was something I did or didn't do but regardless...  No plant should be that difficult to maintain considering it started to look very dried out and droopy come day two.  The soil was very hard & dry and packed way too tight into the pot that it made watering the plant nearly impossible.
