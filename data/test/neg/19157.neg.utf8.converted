Pad thai is the first thing I order at any thai restaurant. It varies depending on the restaurant, but I've always know it to have a tangy peanut sauce that's slightly sweet.<br /><br />However, these noodles just don't taste anything like any of the pad thai dishes I've had. It's also just not very good. The first thing I noticed upon opening the noodles packet was the unnatural smell it emitted. I tasted the noodles plain, and they were very noticeably sour with another unnatural note (detergent... perhaps). I know I did not get an expired package because every Annie Chun's bowl I've had was just like this. And they were all a year or two from expiration.<br /><br />I thought it might get better when I blended in the flavorings, but it didn't improve. Very sour, as if the noodles were seasoned primarily with vinegar. I gobbled them up because I was very hungry at the time, but they were not all that good. They're not very unpleasant, but they could be much better. Though, one nice thing about these is that they're very generous on the noodles, so they fill you up (they left me very satisfied even though I had been famished when I was making them).<br /><br />You also might want to consider that they have strong green onions. My boyfriend had to admit to me (trying not to sound harsh) that they made my breath smell of onions hours afterwards. We're close enough that we don't get embarrassed by things like that, but you that you might not want to have this in the office.
