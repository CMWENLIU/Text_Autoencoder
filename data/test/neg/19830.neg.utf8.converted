Let's see, the name of the product is 'Lakewood Organic Fresh Pressed Papaya'. Look closely, though, because behind the 3, count them 3, papayas on the label, there is an apple. Yep, and at the bottom of the label it does say blend. And it smells and tastes like Apple Juice, its MAIN ingredient. Private Note to Lakewood and Amazon: How about calling the product what it really is- Apple Juice with a little papaya? Honesty in advertising, anybody?
