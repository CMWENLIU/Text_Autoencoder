This product is a total rip off - it is just one pouch of food.  I ordered this with a bunch of other baby food products all of which were around the same price but contained multiple units.  I guess I didn't read this one carefully enough.  I can't even believe amazon would sell one pouch much less at this price.  Of course, now I am worried about ordering again because food cannot be returned.  Most expensive baby food i ever purchased!
