I wanted to like this..maybe its because I can drink regular coffee<br />without the nasty side effects of acid problems, that this did not<br />taste so good to me.  I love dark roast coffees but this one really<br />was not what I had hoped for.  It was odd tasting to me, more bitter<br />than other dark french roasts are.  I usually drink my coffee black,<br />but even the addition of 1/2-n-1/2 didn't help save the rest of the<br />pot from being poured down the sink.  I gave it two stars as I also<br />know that taste is like art...subjective.
