I will be honest. I have never tried Zevia and am hesitant to do so because if I do indeed like it I will not be able to AFFORD IT!!!! My husband drinks soda like water and I am trying to steer him in a more healthy direction; hence my wanting to try Zevia. Why is it that everything that is better for your health is so expensive?! I mean $24.00 for a case of soda is astronomical when you can buy a case of the popular brands for no more than $8.00. With the economy the way it is I will just have to wait until I land a better job so that I can afford to be more healthy!
