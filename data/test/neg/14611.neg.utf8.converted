Clams in a can are as tasteless as sweet peas in a can. I have tried many different brands but unfortunately all clams in cans are  tasteless. These clams are/(suppose to be) from US not from the Orient like other brands. Although 6.5 oz, you only get 3 oz which is less than a cup and still more expensive than 10oz cans.  I do not consume these for taste. Instead of buying supplements I consume these clams since it's ready to go without any hard labour for B12, iron and protein. I rinse to get rid of 500 mg sodium and sand which regardless after rinse there is still sand in these clams. For real clam taste I buy fresh clams from Costco and boil it myself for three minutes.
