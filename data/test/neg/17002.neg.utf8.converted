"Blends smooth and creamy for a sweet tasting protein"  is in the item description. I don't know who wrote this but they must not have ever smelled or tasted this stuff! Based on the description, I purchased a few of these bags. They come vacuum sealed. The color of the powder is a light olive green. The taste is a combination of powdered sawdust, wheatgrass and every dark green health food store drink you've ever had. The only reason it gave it a star at all is well, there's no choice for zero, and it probably does have decent nutritional properties. But while forcing myself to drink this stuff, I got flashbacks from 3 years old when I was forced to eat spinach. The good news is Amazon refunded the cost of the purchase even though it's a "non-refundable" product. You have to call them to do it. They didn't even want me to send back the unopened bags! But I really want to return them. It seems a shame to have to throw them away.
