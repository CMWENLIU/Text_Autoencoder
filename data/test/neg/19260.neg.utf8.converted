This is not a great green tea. It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion. The taste is weak so one has to use a lot of this tea, which results in an over-caffeinated beverage. Finally, even the color of the tea itself is on the yellow side rather than green. Not a satisfactory purchase!
