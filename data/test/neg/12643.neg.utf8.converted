I'm a fan of most ginger candy. Apart from being somewhat bothersome to unwrap, this brand suffers from inconsistent quality. I've found that in two separate bags purchased about half the candy was tender and chewy while every other candy was more less tender and had more of a chunky texture that broke into pieces while chewing.
