The actual cereal is fine, but why on Earth do I need individual packets of it?  I thought I was buying the large box (like the one I bought at Whole Foods).  Instead it was 12 boxes containing individual packets of cereal.  Obviously I should have read the description more closely, but I'm sleep deprived.  The carbon footprint on this is just insane!
