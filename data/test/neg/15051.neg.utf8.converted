I was so excited to get these vegan soups. The packaging is so deceiving with a name like Dr. McDougall and vegan. Unfortunately I didn't read the other reviews before purchasing like I usually do. And I read the ingredient label after they arrived. They have MSG aka "yeast extract" and "natural flavors and cannot be returned according to Amazons return policy. Waste of my hard earned money. Lesson learned!
