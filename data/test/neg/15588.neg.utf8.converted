So these sticks taste ok, I mean, it's jerky, how do you mess that up? My issue is with the expiration date, which was a little less than one month from when I got my box. How am I supposed to eat 50 of these things in 25 some-odd days? That's just cheap trying to offload these so close to the expiration date. Never buying these again.
