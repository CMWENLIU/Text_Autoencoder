Initially, I bought the product because on the bag it said was manufactured and distributed from South Carolina.  Also on the bag were the words, "American Product", was not until I got home did I discover, "Made in China" on the lower corner of the bag.  Waggin Train needs to let their customers know if the contents of the bag are made in U.S. and only the bag is made in China.  If indeed the treats are made in China, then distributed from the warehouse in South Carolina, the company should be upfront with their customers.  It is hard to have confidence in the company when they claim it IS an American product, yet made in China!
