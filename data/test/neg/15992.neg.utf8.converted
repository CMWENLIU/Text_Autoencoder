I was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).<br /><br />The texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.<br /><br />I thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these.
