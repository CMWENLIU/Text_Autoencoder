This tuna is stored in water + salt and has NO flavor.  I have to add Genoa Tonno tuna in oil to get a fair amount of flavor,  the<br />Genoa Tonno is swimming in oil so it mixes up ok but the Wild Planet tuna must be well broken up and it is a solid cake and takes a lot of effort.<br />Finally I got Chicken of the Sea Albacore tuna in oil and it is like tuna from the good old days years ago.
