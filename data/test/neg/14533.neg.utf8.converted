Neither version of this stuff works for squirrels and raccoons.  Maybe for deer, dogs and cats, but that's not our problem - it's the squirrels, mostly.  Will try for coyote urine granules instead.<br />How do lousy products like Critter Ridder even make it into stores?  I guess for suckers like us who don't read reviews on Amazon first.
