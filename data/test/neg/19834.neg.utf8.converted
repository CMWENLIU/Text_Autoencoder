I've tried several other stevia flavours from the same manufacturer, and they've been fine.  The Chocolate rsspberry was a real bad choice.  I got no sense of chocolate at all, save for the smell, and the raspberry essense was cloying and perfumey...VERY strange.  Choose your flavours with extreme care.  This one screwed my mug of coffee!
