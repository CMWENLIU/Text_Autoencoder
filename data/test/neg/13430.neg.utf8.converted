I normally grab this item at the local pet store and my cats (and carpets) absolutely love it.<br /><br />A couple months ago, I purchased a couple boxces from Amazon to fill out a shopping cart. Bad move. Not only did neither box grow a single blade of grass, but one of them spoiled and smelled horrible for a day or so.<br /><br />Amazon's excellent customer service jumped in and sent two more boxes last week for no charge. When I saw the dates on the box were different, I was relieved and expected to have grass growing any day. I was wrong. Something is not right with Amazon's supply. Not a single blade of grass from four boxes now.<br /><br />Spend the extra couple of bucks and pick this stuff up locally. You cats (and dogs) will thank you.
