This product and other similar Agave products are as bad or worse than High Fructose Corn Syrup.  This is not a bad comparison or exaggeration.  You are not consuming 'nectar' from the Agave plant, you are consuming the final result of the same process that corn is put through to become Fructose Syrup.  The ONLY reason the FDA has not been able to force this product to be labeled as Fructose Syrup is because it more closely resembles Inulin, which is actually sweeter, and worse in this case, than Fructose Syrup.  Stay away from Agave products unless you want a good Tequila.<br /><br />For further information, see other reviews rated at 1 star, and research online for the bad news.  Don't just shrug it off and ignore it.  If you're like me, you will be disgusted with the feeling of betrayal, and you'll want to warn everybody you can.
