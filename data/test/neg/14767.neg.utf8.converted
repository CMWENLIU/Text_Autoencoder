I purchased this variety and the salmon chowder variety this company sells, to send as Christmas gifts.  I decided to sample both varieties prior to mailing and since I love all of the stated ingredients, I had high expectations of the taste and quality of these soups.  I was wrong, and was very disappointed.  This soup (bean) tastes far, far better than the Salmon Chowder variety, but was also disappointing, mainly because the hotness of the soup overpowers any other flavors!  It was hard to taste the "smoked salmon" at all because of this.  The texture of this soup is good and the beans were flavorful, when I could taste them over the overwhelming "spice" of the soup.  If they would cut the heat of this soup in half, they may have a much better product.  As is, I'm unable to send this variety, nor the awful salmon chowder variety, to my dad after all.  More gift hunting for me....darn.
