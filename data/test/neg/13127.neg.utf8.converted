Re: Caffe Appassionato Sumatra, Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)"<br /><br />This has got to be the worst Sumatra coffee I've ever tasted, and possibly the worst coffee to ever come out of my coffee maker.<br /><br />I was glad to see Sumatra coffee available on Amazon and that you could "subscribe" to get it regularly too.  Having learned to drink & enjoy coffee during an extended stay in the Netherlands and for almost 15 years now having been a fan of the world's best coffee, Douwe Egberts<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TU98E">Douwe Egberts Ground Coffee - Medium Roast (8.8 Ounce) by igourmet.com</a> I'm picky and 100% arabica is important.<br /><br /> Although the web page says it's 100% arabica, this is very hard to believe when you see the package and smell it. The labelling on the package mentions nothing about containing arabica beans.<br /><br />I hardly ever write reviews on Amazon, but this is just sooo bad. It's shocking. Despite repeated brewing at different strengths and different machines, different filters, etc. nothing works.<br /><br />It's just bad coffee.<br /><br />Bitter.<br /><br />Acidic.<br /><br />Yeccch.<br /><br />Sumatra coffee and the arabica bean are supposed to cut down on the acidity and bitterness, but this is some of the most acidic and bitter coffee I've tasted.<br /><br />Who knows maybe I got a bad batch, but Amazon's policy is "no returns allowed."  So I guess the remaining 2 pounds will go down the disposal.
