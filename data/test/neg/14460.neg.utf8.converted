Once again confusing profiteering with prophet steering-<br />Rabbi plays the bait and switch. Ingredients on amazon<br />clearly state soybean oil but on the can is listed as<br />cottonseed a potential pesticide and industrial chemical<br />laden oil which is unfit for consumption and is used in<br />only the poorest quality big agribusiness-sellout items.<br />I will send this back or throw it in the trash and not purchase<br />this poor excuse for kosher product line again.<br />Why detox when we can prevent putting toxins in our bodies<br />to begin with. Yes I am Jewish.
