I should start by saying I love the Starbux Via coffees - they really are good "emergency" coffee.  I normally brew my own espresso every day, but I use the Via packs when I don't have time for that and need to hit the road with my caffeine fix.  I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product.  When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life.  The box I was sent expires in two months.  A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me.  If I had known they are selling these boxes at such a good price because they are about to expire, I would have passed on this "bargain".  But if you plan to drink them all in a month or two, it is a good buy.
