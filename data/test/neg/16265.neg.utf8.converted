I was born and raise in Vietnam so I have drunk coconut juice my entire life. I guess that makes me somewhat credible because I can tell if this tastes like the real thing or not.<br />So last week I had a craving for coconut water so I decided to hit up the local supermarket and tried a few brands including Taste Nirvana, Sunvoi, Kimbo, and Laguna ***ALL MADE IN THAILAND***. Taste Nirvana was sold at Ralphs for $2.90 and the other 3 were at Asian supermarket @ $.99/ea. So why did I dish out $2.90 for this can? Because I was simply doing a taste test so I didn't bother ordering from Amazon. Let's move on with the comparison<br /><br />Taste Nirvana: 2.5/5<br />Pro:<br />-Eye catching design on the can<br />-PROBABLY healthy<br />Con:<br />-Bland, lacking in taste<br />-Expensive unless you buy from Amazon *but watch out for the horrible packaging*<br /><br />Kimbo: 3.5/5<br />Pro:<br />-Cheap (16.2 OZ for only 99 cent)<br />-Tastes pretty damn good surprisingly<br />Con:<br />-Cheap looking design just like Amy & Brian coconut<br />-Not available in Non-Asian supermarkets<br /><br />Sunvoi 1/5<br />Pro:<br />-Cheap<br />Con:<br />-Forgettable taste<br />-Not sold in US supermarket (though this is really a pro)<br /><br />Laguna: 0/5<br />Pro:<br />???<br />Con:<br />-Sugar filled water<br />-Being sold in supermarket<br />-Probly gives you disease if you drink the whole can
