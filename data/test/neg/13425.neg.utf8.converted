My first negative review......<br /><br />This is NOT real Tupelo honey!  In fact I doubt if its pure/real honey at all.  It crystallizes QUICKLY, much faster than the cheap-o store brands, spring blossom or even clover.  Tupelo honey should NEVER EVER crystallize, hence the high price.  With this product your paying a premium price for a extremely poor quality honey.  I'm also willing to bet they use HFCS as a "food" for the bee's.  If you want REAL Tupelo honey look elsewhere.  Do NOT purchase this product if you enjoy real/raw/quality honey!<br /><br />I will be contacting Amazon.com to see if there is any recourse for this purchase.  Amazon has the BEST customer service, and will continue to do 99% of my shopping on the site.
