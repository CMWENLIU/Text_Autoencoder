I had ordered the sweet and sour Charms before and was very happy with them.  So I was very disappointed when the sweet pops arrived.  A large amount of them were not only broken but shattered.  Also, all but about 10 of them where cherry.  Don't get me wrong, I like cherry.  But other flavors were supposed to be in there.  I only got one watermelon and one blue raspberry.  I will not be ordering from this company again.
