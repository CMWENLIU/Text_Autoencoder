I have bought this cereal in the store in the past. The stores seem to have stopped selling it. I was thrilled when I saw I could buy it from Amazon.com. I did buy it but the cereal doesn't taste the same as it did before in my opinion. I don't know if the manufacture changed the formula but it just didn't taste as good.
