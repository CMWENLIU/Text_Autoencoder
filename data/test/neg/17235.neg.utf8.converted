I thought these would taste great thinking they came from one of my favorite marts. They tasted very bleh, and I agree with the other reviews I have seen other reviews it tastes like soap. Also since this was bought in the store instead of online. Because sometimes the online stores sell fake stuff. I followed the directions and even tried it without ice to see if I would like it better. Well it tastes horrible, I can describe it as unsweetened kool-aid fruit punch with a chemical taste like splenda sugar or something. Avoid this, I believe they had changed the formula. I was reading old and recent reviews and it seems it used to be tasty till they changed the formula and tastes like crap. You have been warned guys.
