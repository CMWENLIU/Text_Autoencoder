I bought this to try and deal with some unruly neighbor's cats that love to come on my back porch and window battle with my cat.  They have ruined my screen door with their fighting.  I thought I would set this up around the perimeter of the porch to keep them away from the back door and also give my cat some peace of mind.  What the description doesn't tell you is that the fence cannot work unless the animal has contact with the ground and the wire and that it won't conduct through concrete nor can it have any brush in contact with it.  Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.  Also, only one wire will be electrified and the animal has to be in contact with it and the ground in order to get a the shock so I imagine that a cat would automatically just jump over it.  I guess I'll never be able to test that theory.  Was very disappointed that I had to return it without even giving it a try.
