I should have been more careful in checking ingredients and get very angry when products purport to be healthful (ie, organic, gluten free, top-notch and unusual grains) but miss the mark.<br /><br />Nature's Path describes this as "...cereal of flax, corn and amaranth." Now look at the ingredients which, of course, are listed from most to least. The first 2 are cornmeal and corn flour--hardly the most nutritious of grains. Third is organic evaporated cane juice yielding 4 grams of sugar per serving, and then come the flax, buckwheat, quinoa and amaranth.<br /><br />JUST HOW MUCH OF THESE SUPER GRAINS CAN POSSIBLY BE INCLUDED if the 3rd highest ingredient is the sugar at 4 grams?!<br /><br />And that's another pet peeve: why any added sugar at all. Most health-conscious consumers do not want added sugars, even cane juice.  And this also leads me to question the "nutrition facts" posted on the products. If cane juice is the 3rd item in quantity, and corn has a relatively high sugar content, can there really be only 4 grams of sugar per serving?
