The basic concept is there but someone cut too many corners trying to save a buck.  The plastic stakes should be replaced with simple tent stakes so they could be hammered into hard ground more easily.  These have blunt bottoms.  Why?  It is very hard to hammer these into anything but soft sand.  Also, the wire is a ball of wire instead of a rolling spool. This was a real pain in the ass trying to untangle the ball of wire they give you.  And putting the wire through a tiny hole in the stake?  How about a small spur on each stake that the wire could simply be looped around once to secure it rather than having to thread each one like a needle.  Once it was up it worked and then it didn't.  Probably my fault as if any part of the wire grounds it won't work.  But with the cheap wire and stakes it's hard to get a sturdy run that doesn't touch something.  When it does work it gives a nice shock but the only way to test it is to either zap yourself (or one of your kids) or buy a cheap lamp tester ($8.00)  Again, should be included with this product.  For the money this chould be a lot more user friendly.
