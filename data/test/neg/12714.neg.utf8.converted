I hate to write this kind of negative review, but i cannot recommend anyone buy from made in nature because they do not make good on their product guarantee.  These figs can be great -- and they can be horribly infested.  if you eat calmyrnas you know you have to check each one for wasps -- i expect that.  But I also found little beetle-like bugs that i have never before found in figs, as well as a lot of simple bad-tasting figs.  Amazon does not accept grocery returns, but made in nature promises 100% satisfaction.  Well, i am 0% satisfied after several phone calls and emails i never reached a human, never got return instructions or authorization, and i am still out almost $200 for several cases (we eat a lot of figs!) of inedible, bug-laden figs.
