I also received a box that was rancid! I'm so disappointed. My kids and I just opened our first box tonight and it smelled horrible! You couldn't smell it until you opened the cellophane and then it hit you. The individual bags were each soaked through. NOT the boxes, the actual bags of popcorn had oil soaked through them. The boxes looked fine; they weren't crushed or old in appearance or anything like that. I have always bought Orville Redenbacher's popcorn this is the first time I've ever had this problem. I think my days of shopping for food online are over. I can't take this kind of lose :(
