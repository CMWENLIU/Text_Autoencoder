First off I would like to say that I thought long and hard about buying this. I read other reviews claiming these were "stale" and "not stored well" and I would like to say this is 100% correct. You might not notice it very much, but it is correct. The airheads are not gooey and chewy like they should be. I got several hard lumps of something in many of them. There was no green apple flavor, only mystery, watermelon, blue raspberry, cherry, orange and pink lemonade. The orange and cherry had the most problem with deformation (melted and then hardened into different forms).<br />The flaws with these airheads are subtle and will only apparent to an airhead connoisseur. If you don't mind these very subtle flaws and love airheads, buy this! But if you want fresh delicious airheads buy them elsewhere.
