We got a very serious reaction to this bread.  Anybody else experience problems?  Any idea what we might be reacting to?  The bread was wonderful, in smell, texture, and taste.  I just skipped the egg + egg whites thing and used three eggs, adjusting the other liquid which was trader Joes rice milk.  I wish we could eat this.  It is so good.  People who are having trouble with the final product might try calibrating their ovens temperature, i.e. find out if your oven thermostat runs hot or cold.  Another trick if you have an old oven is to preheat it to 50 degrees more than required, put in your pan, and immediately turn the oven down to the correct temperature.  Anyway, anyone have any idea why this bread makes us violently ill?
