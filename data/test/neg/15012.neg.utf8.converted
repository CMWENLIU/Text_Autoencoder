After Tassimo and Starbucks parted ways, I tried Maxwell House as a possible replacement.  Yes, I get a full cup of coffee (as opposed to the espresso packs that require four to fill a cup), but it has a strange aftertaste that wasn't there in any of the Starbucks varieties I used to get.  If you're looking for a Starbucks replacement for a full-bodied coffie, this isn't a good choice.
