Put a carob dipped hazelnut in your mouth, then a tablespoon of honey, and that approximates the flavor of these. I could not get past more than half a cookie. Just too sweet. There needs to be a balance of flavors in something like a cookie. This is a lopsided treat.<br /><br />If you don't like cloyingly sweet treats, this won't do. You'd better really love a punch of honey.
