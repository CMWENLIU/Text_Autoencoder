HEED THE REVIEWS.<br /><br />This thing is TINY. Like... ridiculously small. My husband got this for me for Mother's Day. It came in the regular old amazon box. I opened the box and there was this tiny little thing inside, shrink wrapped and pathetic looking. Someone in the reviews said it "was an embarrassment" to give. That about sums it up. I didn't think it was possible to feel worse about my miscarriage, but then this pathetic thing arrived on my doorstep. Not only that, but it was delivered over a week late (we opted for 2 day shipping). The description doesn't bother to mention anything about the contents, so allow me: 15 small chocolate items. Small, small, small. There were 3 regular sized chocolate bars and the rest were miniatures.<br /><br />They sell those mini Ghirardelli squares for 50 cents at convenience stores. Yet somehow 4 of those, 3 chocolate bars, and some other miscellaneous minis stuffed haphazardly in a cheap, crappy basket and shrink wrapped in a shipping facility cost $40??<br /><br />I don't know how else to phrase it, this thing sucks.<br /><br />We learned our lesson with this "gift basket" stuff- BUY IN PERSON (same goes for flower arrangements).
