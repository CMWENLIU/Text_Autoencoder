I tried this item for the first time after having purchased from Walmart. I thought it would be good, especially I noticed an "award" emblem on the front of the package. After opening and trying this product, I don't really know what that award was truly for. Being very environmentally conscious, I feel that the packaging is too excessive, the rusks are individually wrapped in non-recyclable something(?), and all the individual packets are packaged in non recyclable plastic film, all contained in a carboard box. I also didn't realize that this was made in China at the time I purchased it (I was in a hurry). My 9 month old can't eat these right now - I will go back to other dissolvable foods like "puffs" for now. My four year old, however, wants to eat these more than my 9 month old and since my four year old is so skinny, these are not the ideal snacks for her either, since they don't have much nutritional value if you read the side of the box. I love Amazon, but I would never order this particular item from them and I would not reccommend this item to new parents.
