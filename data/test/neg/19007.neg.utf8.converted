I open up my new bag of 360 today and take my 2 110lb dogs for a walk.  I open up the bag to pick up my dog's droppings to find out the damn bag has been shortened.  What a HUGE PIA.  Not only are they shorter, they are also thinner.  What a complete waste of money, now I have 358 bags that I have no need for.  Looks like it's time to find another bag for my dogs.
