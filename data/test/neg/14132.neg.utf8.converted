I've found the Liver Biscotti to be a great tool when training my dogs.  Unfortunately, I ordered the "Small Bite Size" this time as I have a new puppy.  Don't do it, unless you're planning to use the treats for gerbils!  They're basically super small broken bits about the size of grape nuts that the dog inhales, many times having to cough it back up.  The regular size is definitely the way to go.
