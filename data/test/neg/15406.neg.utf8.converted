We have been purchasing Tim Horton's coffee for many years now. It is a superior roast. The disappointing part is the size of the can. We started off with 1.2 kg, a few months ago the can was made smaller - we went down to 1.0 kg. A few weeks ago the product was 'out of stock' for a couple of weeks only to return at 930 grams. So in less than a year 270 grams were removed - this is 1/2 lb. I understand that coffee prices are soaring but I really wish Tim Hortons was up front about what is happening - not sneaking in a can that contains less product in order to keep the price the same. I would much rather pay the price for the original can size then getting smaller and smaller product every few months.
