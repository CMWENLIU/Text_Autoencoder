I am so sad that Stride changed their gum. The nonstop mint used to last me all day with just one piece, the new 2.0 version tastes different and doesn't last long at all, maybe an hour per piece. I went by the picture and thought I was getting 1.0 Stride. I am dissapointed the product I received is not the product pictured.<br /><br />The shipping was super fast though and the price is great.
