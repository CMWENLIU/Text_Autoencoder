0 stars and even that is too many.<br />If you are bound and determined to eat these things (any flavor) then please take the time to read and study  Glucomannan, where it comes from and the possible side effects of consuming it.<br />Frankly, I cannot believe that it is being sold as a food product to be consumed in a fairly large quantity.<br /><br />Should you eat these noodles do plan on staying close to home as you may find that the  Glucomannan has quite an effect on your digestive system.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather eat a tree.<br /><br />Plus they smell just awful - when you open the package you get a waft of dead fish.
