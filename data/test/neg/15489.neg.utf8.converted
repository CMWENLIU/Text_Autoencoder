I did not look carefully at the ingredients' list when I ordered these treats. Once they arrived, I noticed they contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back. They are a hard, crunchy treat so your dog is definitely going to use the back teeth to chew them where they could get a cavity. While they smell great and contain some healthy ingredients, it just wasn't worth it to me to take that chance. There are other tasty dog treats on the market that I won't have that worry with so I sent them back.
