This product did not rise in my bread machine. It's heavy and brown and yucky. It's expensive, and it requires the addition of whipping cream - a not inexpensive ingredient. PLUS, the mix should be stored in refrig. All in all this is a HORRIBLE product. Do not buy. Hodgson Mill European Cheese & Herb Bread Mix is 1000% better!
