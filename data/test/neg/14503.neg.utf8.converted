Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute. I bought a jar of this at my local store, as it was on clearance and I'm trying to avoid eating real egg products. It has a very good smell, like real mayonnaise; however, I was put off by its gummy texture. It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury. The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours. I won't be buying this mayonnaise again.
