Both cats turned up their noses at the chicken-flavored version of this, but when I opened the Salmon flavor, my feral queen gave an alarmed "Bip!" and fled, tail streaming out behind her.  Fluffypants wouldn't eat it, but he didn't act like I was trying to poison him, either.  That's two tries, two flavors, two cats, no takers.
