Received the 4 pack of tubes with one of the tubes showing a lot of leakage.  Obviously any food product that is opened or damaged should never be consumed.  Sadly, this seller does not offer replacements and claims no responsibility for damages so I'm out of luck.  I don't think this product was damaged during shipping because the shipping and product boxes were both in tact.  The tube had leaked inside of its own undamaged box and the paste was not fresh but rather dried on the outside of the tube.  Probably sat this way on their shelves and they never checked before shipping.<br /><br />One less tomato-goodness meal for me.  At least I have 3 other tubes to squeeze.  I don't think I would purchase food products online again.  Definitely not from a seller that won't check their products before shipping or offer replacements.
