This item came highly recommended for someone who is pre-diabetic in need of a low carb healthy snack. This snack is about $4.25 for ten ounces in stores. When I found them for $2.82 a bag when you purchase a case of 12 I went for it. The taste is great however about a forth of each bag is crumbs. I got a pound of crumbs total out of three bags. Whether this is from shipping or manufacturing I don't know. I won't purchase on line again.
