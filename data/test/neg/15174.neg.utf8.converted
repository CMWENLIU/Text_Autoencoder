<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPYWY0">R.W. Garcia Soy/Corn with Flax Tortilla Chips, 10 Ounces (Pack of 12)</a><br />The first time we ordered this they were fabulous! Great tasting and crispy. We would have given them a 5 star rating. The second order fell short. They were burned and broken. It was as if we received all the rejects, the botton of the barrel, the left-overs after the party. Very disappointing. We would not recommend buying them unless you can physically see what is in the package.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPYWY0">R.W.
