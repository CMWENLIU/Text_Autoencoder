we love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups.  my bf is a soda addict, drink soda like water, who sneaks out to a deli, which is at least 15 mins away as the closest ones closed at midnight, for a 2 Liter bottle of cherry coke at 3am in the morning. i bought the sodastream jet starter kit and this sodamix variety pack for him as i don't want to buy bottles of sodas from supermarket, carrying them walking at least 2 flights of stairs, separating the trash for recycle and dragging bags of empty bottles out which he promised he will help but rarely does. i bought sodastream totally because i m lazy but not being eco-friendly at all. the 1st day we received them, he made 4 different flavors and made me to finish them all with him that night. he loves to play with the loud buzz button and constantly needs new bottle for another flavor as the starter kit comes with only 1 bpa free bottle.  i never like anything fizzy while he likes it bubbles until his blood fizz like the soda. we tried #1.fountain mist #2.orange #3. lemon-lime #4.diet cola respectively. he hates anything "diet" and complained even the non diet syrups taste like diet. the last one he tested from the variety pack was the diet cola as it doesn't come with the regular cola which he craved. i said the diet cola taste like the regular cola n yuck. he agreed with the yuck but blah blah blah about the taste different between the regular coka cola coke n this sodamix diet cola syrup.  he believed that the sodamix regular cola syrup must be better than the diet one and planned to get it the next day. suddenly he screamed out "splen-daaaaa" in a weird accent while he was reading the ingredients/ nutrition facts. he lost interests in this variety pack and tried to fizz everything drinkable in the fridge: #5. welch's white grape cherry juice just by itself without water, it exploded while the bottle is still intact to the machine, mess everywhere, he said "errrk". #6. water+ribena, considering carbonating the juice creates messes, we just carbonated the water and substitute the syrup with something else, with the same amount of the individually packaged syrup from the variety pack, ribena isnt as concentrated, i continued added more ribena but still taste bland and ended up ran out of ribena. #7. we bought the sodamix regular cola from BB&B the today, while pouring the syrup in after carbonating the water, it just splashed all over the counter top and the kitchen floor. better pour it inside the sink.  he said it tastes better than the diet syrup but still has a slightly aspartame/weird sugar after taste, not as good as the regular coca cola. #8. carbonated water+OJ: 1/4 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ = taste is ok, less strong, not fizzy. 1/2 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ: not fizzy and taste only with a tint of OJ. 1 cup of carbonated water + 1 cup of no pulp OJ, fizzy but bland.  We bought the sodamix cherry cola syrup, but we r full from drinking carbonated sugared liquid these 2 days. we will try it and update tomorrow.
