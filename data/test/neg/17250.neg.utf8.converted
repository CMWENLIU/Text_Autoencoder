I am not an expert on saffron, I was just trying to replace a bottle my mother gave me 25 years ago.  This saffron was not in the same league as my mother's saffron.  Flavor was weak and turned rice dish greenish color instead of the rich yellow/orange I was used to.  Maybe you have to pay more and concentrate on the quality of the spice instead of the attractiveness of the packaging.  Seller delivered product in timely manner. I just wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
