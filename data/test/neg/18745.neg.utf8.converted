I gave my dog one of the Hartz Crunch n Clean dog biscuits and he was very excited. He ran around the house with it in his mouth, drooling like a faucet. After playing for a while, he laid down to eat it. I could definitely tell it was harder to crunch up than the similar sized milkbone, he had to work it around and position it in his jaws just right. Once bitten into a couple of pieces, he ate one half and then took the other half and buried in the couch cushions. Sadly, I think that's probably a "paws down" vote from my dog. Also, at 35 calories, it's a pretty significant contribution to the daily intake for a small dog compared to a small Milkbone at 20 calories and a Liva Snap at 13 calories. If my dog had liked it more, I might give them to him as a special treat which wouldn't really help with regular dental cleaning because it is recommended to give them two biscuits a day (we would have to short him on kibble if we added the treats at that quantity). As he isn't in love with them, I think we'll just see if one of our doggie friends likes them better.
