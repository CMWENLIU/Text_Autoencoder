Been a Spam fan for over 40 yrs. & thought the Bacon Flavored version would be something different. Sorry to say that it just didn't have any, or very little, bacon flavor. Tasted like a can of regular Spam. Called Hormel Customer Service to voice my concerns and got a curt response of "we can't satisfy every customer's tastes", end of conversation. Thought they'd be a bit more receptive to a long time customer's comments but they weren't. If you like regular Spam you'll like this, just don't expect much of a Bacon flavor.
