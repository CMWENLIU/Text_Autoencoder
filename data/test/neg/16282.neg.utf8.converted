If it works remains to be seen as I have just finished treating the exterior of my home.<br />Unfortunately the red on off knob that you rotate to begin spraying is not permanently affixed<br />to the nozzle housing.<br /><br />SO, as I am turning it off after finishing a section (30 ft away from the hose bib) the knob came off<br />resulting in------- THE SOLUTION SPRAYING FULL PRESSURE UP OUT OF THE KNOB HOLE DIRECTLY IN MY FACE!!!!<br /><br />After turning the pressure off I was easily able to reinsert the knob in to its hole and it functions perfectly.<br />No there is nothing broken. It is an obvious and potentially dangerous design flaw.<br /><br />Be careful using this product.
