If you look at the paprika, it's not REAL Hungarian.  Thus, this is why it says Hungarian "style."  Don't be fooled by sellers who sell you Spanish or Chinese paprika under the umbrella of "Hungarian Paprika."  Also, they can't even spell "Kalocsai" right on the can!  So much for their 'Hungarian style' of FAKE Hungarian paprika.  I highly suggest to pass on this item!
