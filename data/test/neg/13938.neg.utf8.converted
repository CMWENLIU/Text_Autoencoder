The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash.
