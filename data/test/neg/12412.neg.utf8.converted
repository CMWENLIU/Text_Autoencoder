Read all the reviews and wanted to love this.After a few months living low carb I was craving blueberry pancakes.First,I was surprised (maybe I'm cluesless)that I had to add baking powder and half and half just for pancakes.We followed directions.Hubby is a pro on pancakes.Although they LOOKED fine when served after a few bites we realized they were raw inside.We arent sure if the blueberries threw it off or what.We got some decent pancakes making them smaller and thinner.(We added water)Not in love with this product but still willing to experiment with it.
