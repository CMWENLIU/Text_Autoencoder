This peanut butter is a favorite in our house.  All 3 of us eat it every day pretty much.  However, we made the mistake of buying a case of it online since it was cheaper.  It could be the heat (we are in California) that ruined it on it's way here, I'm not sure, because it wasn't expired.  However, it tasted very different than what we get at our local grocery store.  Not nearly as good and kind of melty.  This is the best peanut butter out there but take my advice and don't get it mail ordered.
