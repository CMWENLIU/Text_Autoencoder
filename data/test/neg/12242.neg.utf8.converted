These yams were to be a welcome addition to my diet as a better, heathier choice. They fell extremely short of my expectations due to their mushiness. It seems as though these may have been cooked to be used for baby food. Each can has about 1/4 sweet potato silt and many cans are dented. This is a DO NOT BUY!
