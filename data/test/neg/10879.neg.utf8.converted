Someone should find a way to SUE me for being stupid enough to give Walden Farm's lineup of Sauces which SHOULD be savory another shot.... EVERY savory sauce I have tried so far (Ranch, French Onion, blue cheese) has been full of disgust and disappointment...<br /><br />RANCH should NOT be sweet.. it does NOT need the splenda<br />FRENCH ONION should NOT be sweet!!! wtf?!<br />BLUE CHEESE??? come on! WTF would anyone want sweet blue cheese<br /><br />Alfredo sauce... when has anyone ever had SWEET Alfredo sauce?!  I am sooo stupid for buying this... I have NOT been at all impressed by Walden's lineup of the savory type sauces... it is absolutely a crime... these savory sauces would be much better without the sucralose :(  maybe one day I will give it another shot when they remove the stupid unnecessary sweetener...  no amount of hot sauce or garlic could get rid or even mask the sweet flavor... YUCK
