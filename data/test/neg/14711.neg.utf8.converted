First off; I love Pop Secret Homestyle butter popcorn. To me it's as close to movie theater buttered popcorn I've ever found.  Still; I keep a look-out for new ideas like this one.  The 'bowl' idea appealed to me.  Sadly; the design failed to open properly and I had to cut it open.  The popcorn inside was buttery but mediocre in flavor.  Definately; not my Pop Secret Homestyle!  I'm sorry this didn't work out for me.  Somebody will like it though.  Different strokes for different folks; that what my dear Dad has always told his children.  I'm laying in a huge supply of Pop Secret Homestyle and buying a new bowl to put the cooked popcorn in.  Sure; I'm still on the look-out for that perfect theater taste.  I'll have to keep looking and tasting.  I'm sorry this didn't even come close and the newly designed bag that opens from the side (mimicking a bowl but it's still a bag); just doesn't work.
