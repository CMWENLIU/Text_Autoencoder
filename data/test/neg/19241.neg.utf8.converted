The Biscuit Buddy that was sent to me was NOT the type pictured. The style in the picture is made of a high quality, thick, durable material. The pouch that was sent to me is flimsy, thin, and has none of the awesome features that the pouch in the picture has (no zippered pocket, no locking clip).<br /><br />I have returned this product and requested an exchange for the style of pouches that are pictured, or a refund. I will leave more feedback after the exchange/return has been completed. I hope the company does not let me down.<br /><br />UDATE (3/16/2010):<br />Received my requested exchanged item, and to my extreme disappointment, it was exactly the same product I'd received the first time. BEWARE: the product pictured is NOT the product you will receive. The product the company sends is inferior and has none of the same features as the much nicer, higher quality Biscuit Buddy in the picture. I've now requested a complete REFUND from the company. Will purchace the Biscuit Buddy in the picture from a different website. Disappointed.
