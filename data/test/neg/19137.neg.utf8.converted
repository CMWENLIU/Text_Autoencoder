We are new to the gluten-free world but found this bread unexceptable.  Less than 1 star, but that was not an option.  Whether fresh, toasted or grilled it was dry, crumbly, had an odor and strange after taste.  After more checking we found "Sami" millet & flax seed bread. You have to toast or grill it, but it is FANTASTIC.  We are enjoying toast with breakfast and toasted or grilled sandwiches again.  So don't bother with the Ener-G look for Sami
