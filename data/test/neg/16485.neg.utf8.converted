Upon receiving this pea soup, I was disappointed to learn that the recipe has been changed from the one currently listed here on Amazon. Now, cheap potatoes, rice starch and tasteless lentils have been added to the product ingredients, as additional fillers; giving the soup the consistency of a bowl of starchy mashed potatoes. I don't mind "some" potatoes, but there are just too many spuds and starches in this "pea" soup.<br /><br />If you like the consistency and flavor of thick mashed potatoes, this soup is for you.<br /><br />Note that the positive reviews you are reading here apply to the product BEFORE the Recipe and Ingredients were changed for the worse!
