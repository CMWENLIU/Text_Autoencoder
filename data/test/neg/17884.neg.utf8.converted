Previously I had bought and thoroughly enjoyed Adagio Teas Green Tea, Dragon Well.  I wanted to try another brand, and ordered this tea, partly due to being attracted by the organic label and the brand name.<br /><br />What a mistake!<br /><br />First of all, the tea leaves in this tea are so small (almost like ground particles) -- very uncharacteristic of dragon well teas.<br /><br />Second, the taste is so bland, and so weak.  I can swear that all I taste is simply the paper bag!<br /><br />I literally had to throw 5 packs away, with plastic film covers intact!  Along with the first pack that was open.<br /><br />To really taste dragon well tea properly, avoid this tea by all means.  The first tea that I bought, Adagio Teas Green Tea, is heaven compared with this.
