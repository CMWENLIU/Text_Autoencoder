I purchased a case of 12 cans. Out of those 12 cans, only four appear to be undented. EIGHT out of 12 are badly dented. The BOX they are packed in is fine so they had to have been dented when they were packed into the box. This is unacceptable quality control. I gave this 2 stars because of this problem from the seller but I don't know yet what to think of the coconut milk itself as I have not yet opened one of the four seemingly undented cans. Some posters here have said the cans are BPA free but the cans don't look high enough quality to be BPA free. Eden Foods use BPA free cans and their cans LOOK high quality. I hope it is true of the Native Forest coconut milk cans but I'm not sure of that. The number of dented cans in an undamaged box is definitely a big disappointment.
