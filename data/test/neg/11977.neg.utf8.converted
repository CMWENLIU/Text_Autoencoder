FORCED to give it 1 Star because the system wont accept NO STARS.<br /><br />I ordered this cake for my son in the military and had it rushed delivered to him at Ft. Campbell.  It was packed well and arrived on time.<br />The CAKE itself was TERRIBLE.  Noone at the party ate more than one bite.<br />White GREASE was the tasteless frosting and edible decorations were also<br />terrible.  They wanted to lie and tell me it was good so I would not feel like I wasted good money.  However, my son refused to lie and asked if he could contact the sender and demand a refund.  I told him dont bother, we will never order from them again and we will advise others to shop elsewhere.
