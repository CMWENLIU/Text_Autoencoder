We purchased this sourdough starter because, well, we wanted some fresh sourdough!  But -- upon arrival -- all we ended up with was disappointment.  We followed the directions explicitly and still ended up with a bad batch of starter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-"high maintenance" -- it has a laundry-list of things to do and not do.  We followed them to the T, but still ended up killing it.<br />-It requires you to put it in the oven for 7 days with the oven light on.  Not only is it slow-to-grow, I hated leaving the oven light on for that long.<br />-Requires a lot of food and space.  We ended up growing it in a medium-sized kitchen bowl because it probably wouldn't fit in a jar.<br />-Obviously the biggest: after babying it for 5 days, it ended its life.<br />-Looks like its a "tourist gift."  I don't know, but -- for some reason -- this really bothered me.  It felt like something you'd pick up out of a gift shop rather than a baking supply.  This may also be the reason for the above.<br /><br />I can't speak to the quality of bread because we never got to that point.  But there are better starters available then this one.
