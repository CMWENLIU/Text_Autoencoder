I ordered 3 of the item. $168!!!  You think I'd be getting 3 packages of 5 tubes of 10 capsules total of 150 capsules, which by the price it would be close to buying them from Nesspresso... think again. In fact you will receive 3 tubes, each with 10 capsuls! 30 capsules FOR $168! or $6 a cup of coffee. Sweet.<br />i might have Joker in my name, but this is no joke.
