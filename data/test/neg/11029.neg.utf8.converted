I bought this item from Ozbo.  When I got the box, I saw the side was saturated and it was obvious that some of the jars broke.  I opened the box and there was NO PACKING WHATSOEVER.  They put the package of 12 glass bottles and a box and shipped it off.  Four bottles were broken and I was able to salvage 8.  Didn't bother to try sending back because it wouldn't have been worth the hassle, plus I doubt whatever carrier shipped it would not accept the box in the clearly saturated condition.
