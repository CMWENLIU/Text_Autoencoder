I was in middle of a warm work day and due to lack of other brands available, bought two boxes of Naked. I drank the first box and it was just off. It was lacking the natural sweetness and tasted like it had passed its prime. There's something off in the taste, almost as if they crush the coconuts whole and some of the shell got in and gave it that odd taste.<br /><br />Still willing to give it a chance, I tossed the other box in the fridge for a couple days until I could get my hands on a Zico and Vita Coco. Trying them all back to back, Naked juice loses significantly. My girlfriend said it made her want to throw up the first time she tried it. It lacks the freshness and subtle sweetness of Zico and Vita Coco. Naked seems to be more widely available, which is a shame because if this is someone's first taste of coconut water, they will be disappointed.<br /><br />Go with Zico (Tetra Pack, stay away from the bottle) or Vita Coco. ONE is decent but has a strange almost chemical/artificial sweetener aftertaste, like a Pepsi compared to a Coke, a bit sweeter yet odd.
