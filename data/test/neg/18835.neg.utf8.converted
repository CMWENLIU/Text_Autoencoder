This product contains yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent that is a regulated chemical that seems to be a concern when taken in high amounts.  No surprise as it contains cyanide.  It also affects what you can do with it in terms of pickling and brining.  The USFDA CFR Title 21, v6 Sec 573.1020 regulates it in the following way -- notice that it doesn't say HUMAN consumption:  The exact wording in the Code of Fed Regs is "Yellow prussiate of soda...may be safely used as an anticaking agent in salt for animal consumption at a level not to exceed 13 parts per million.  The additive contains a minimum of 99.0 percent of weight of sodium ferrocyanide decahydrate."  I bought this at the grocery store and am throwing it away.  It may not be "much" in terms of contaminants from this single product (altho they COULD use food grade diatomaceous earth and have the same "anticaking" effect), but given we are being bombed with contaminants like this from all sides in our foods, every little bit of avoidance seems like the smarter option.  I recommend you do not buy this salt -- look for Kosher salt options that do not have additives.  If your salt cakes, you can easily crush it and add a spoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) and mix it well -- this does a good job as well.  The "convenience" of free-flowing kosher salt is not worth the added chemical ingestion...
