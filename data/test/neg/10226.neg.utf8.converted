I bought this because it sounded like a less-refined sugar (such as Rapadura, which is granular rather than crystalline). I would have given this one star except I see, looking at the description, that it does say on the product page that the ingredients are "Cane sugar crystals and food grade carnauba wax".  Had I noticed this ahead of time I wouldn't have ordered it - food grade carnauba wax??  YUM!!!  And I don't think there's any way to get crystals from sugar cane other than by refining it the same way white cane table sugar is refined, and then adding molasses back in.<br /><br />As far as the flavor and texture, which previous reviewers found so remarkable - to me it tastes exactly like dark brown sugar from the supermarket, and has a similar texture, but with a burned-molasses aftertaste that stayed with me for hours, even after I ate an apple to try and get rid of it - that's the "strong,lingering flavor" that the description mentions, I guess.  Actually, when you think about it, that's what sugar cane grown in volcanic ash WOULD taste like.  Also I got the same "cattle prod to the brain" - type jolt from this stuff that I used to get from refined white or brown sugar, which I no longer eat.<br /><br />So since I'm going to immediately give this away to friends who still eat refined sugar, I can't speak to how this would work in barbecue or brownies or any of the other things mentioned in the other reviews.  I was going to try some of it in coffee, just to be fair, and to see if the aftertaste problem was less intense that way, however I can't re-open the jar!  It was almost impossible to open the first time - I had to bang the edge of the lid on the countertop multiple times and then run hot water over it - but I thought it would be easier to open after that, since I didn't tighten the lid down hard when I replaced it.  I don't usually have problems opening jars, so I don't know, maybe it's made this way on purpose to keep the contents fresh or something.  If I were going to keep this for myself, the only way I could get it open at this point would be to slice into the plastic container with a serrated bread knife - not the safest way to open a jar.<br /><br />The two 2.8 lb. jars were $28.00, I think, and thank Heaven I got free shipping, however I could have gotten an equivalent amount of dark brown sugar at the grocery store for less than $10.00, if that's what I had wanted.  So I hate to go against some of the other really quite lyrical reviews of this stuff, but to me it's just incredibly expensive, funny-tasting, impossible-to-open brown sugar.
