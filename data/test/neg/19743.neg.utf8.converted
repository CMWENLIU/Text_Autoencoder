I guess it had to happen sooner or later but this is my first disappointment buying from Amazon. No aroma when the bag was opened and totally tasteless. I bought in spite of the negative reviews and now will man up and regret it. Too bad because it was to be my first subscribe and save experience. After contacting customer service full credit was issued, subscribe and save cancelled and I was asked to dispose of the item. Five Stars for Amazon!
