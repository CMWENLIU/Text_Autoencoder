I did some research on just exactly what kind of "cinnamon" is actually used in this product because I became concerned when I read a few of the reviews. Eight paragraphs down on the Simply Organics website they state that they use Korintje (Cinnamomum burmanii). To quote the website "The most commonly found cinnamon in American kitchens is Indonesian cassia. It is sourced from higher elevations and is harvested a bit earlier than Chinese and Vietnamese cinnamons. Korintje translates as "thick quill" and is judged for quality based on the part of the tree that is harvested (trunk vs. branch) and on the length of the bark peeled from the tree. We bring you the highest quality Korintje cinnamon available."<br /><br />So they DO use Cassia and not the Ceylon, true cinnamon. They also state that Cassia and Cinnamon are not the same, they start with that. Then they end the product description explaining all the health benefits of TRUE CINNAMON, not the Cassia that they are really selling you. I really wish I had known that they used the Cassia, because I would not have bought it. And I do realize that they are trying to confuse you, the consumer into thinking that their product is really good for you. This is why everyone should research the products that they use and inform themselves of what they are consuming!<br /><br />[...]
