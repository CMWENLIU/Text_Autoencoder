Well, I read the prior reviews and ordered based on those, that was my first mistake.  My second was not verifying ounces described.  I received my box today and for the price I paid this is definitely not what I had imagined.  For $34.00 I could have gone to my local grocery to the old world section and bought a nicer selection to make my own gift box and it would have cost me alot less.  I bought this for a gift and hope that it tastes better than it looks.  At this point this is the only reason I have not returned it, more hassle to return and the hope that quality is better than the quantity.  I don't recommend the item for the cost as there is more filler paper than product in the box.
