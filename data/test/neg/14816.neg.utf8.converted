From the name and the description, I was expecting a creamy drink.  This is just coffee with a little caramel flavoring, barely enough to taste.  I'd rather have plain coffee than this.  I was looking for something really creamy with a nice caramel flavoring.  I finally found it - Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino.  It is exactly what I wanted.  It's sweet and creamy and I don't have to add a thing to make it taste the way I want it to. Great for a special treat to myself. And if you like that kind of drink, I also recommend Cafe Escapes Chai Tea Latte.  It has a wonderful aroma and flavor too.
