my wife tried making tuna sammies for me with this meat. she would prepare it the night before, and by the time i wanted to eat it the next day for lunch, it would have very strong fishy smell. strong enough to where i did not want to eat it (and i am NOT a fussy eater). we did not have this problem with other tuna (i don't recall what brands, it could have been the same). so we only use it for same time consumption or for cooking.
