This tea is just ok.  I had been searching around for a tea that would taste a bit like juice and ran into this at a store. A nice fruity iced tea on a summer day would have been nice but this has failed me. To be fair I gave it a try both hot and cold and if you like warm tea you will not be pleased as this tea is much weaker hot than cold. Tastes mostly like water the "flavor" is almost non-existant. I am not happy with this.
