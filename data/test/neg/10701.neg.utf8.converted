Overall the selection is interesting and reminds me of the candy that my grandparents had at their house, even though there were many uninspired items that are common today.  The quality is rather poor and a good percentage of the items were stale or inedible due to their hardness. Even without the stale candy, the value was lacking since most of this candy is still common today and available in the bulk candy section of supermarkets.  I would reccomend that you skip this one.<br /><br />I bought this as a spare christmas gift (you know for the person who shows up with a gift but you forgot) and didn't need it.  I was excited to open this myself and was almost immediately dissapointed.  The selection was a bit off I think and included candy you can get in the bulk candy section of the supermarket.  This candy was mostly as hard as a rock and stale.  There were cough (throat) drops from the smith brothers. Throat drops are not my idea of candy.
