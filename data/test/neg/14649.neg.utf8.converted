I had been using this product to make homemade Nicaraguan chorizo. This product is indeed flavorable and authentic. However, I found that it dries out and hardens before I have the chance to use all of it, even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a Tupperware container. For this reason, I now order annatto (achiote) powder instead, and add additional flavorings to it, according to a recipe in one of my Nicaraguan cookbooks. I figure I can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in Nicaragua (not here in the States) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for. I can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such.
