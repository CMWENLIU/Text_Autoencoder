I was bitterly disappointed with this product.  The blue tends towards grayish- not a vibrant color.  The yellow is quite nice.  The red is basically brown.  You can't mix it with anything and it looks awful on its own.  My son's "under the sea" birthday cupcakes came out with grayish frosting instead of blue and the batch of peppermint cookies that I just tried to turn pink came out beige.  I'll have to stick to making yellow items I guess...
