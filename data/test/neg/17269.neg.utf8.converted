I was really upset about the flavor of this product.  I bought two cases, spent more than $40 and the only person in my house who will eat it is the dog.  I had higher expectations for both the texture and the overall flavor- we bought hot and spicy and BBQ varieties; despite the added flavoring, it was pretty bland.  The texture was practically dusty- not chewy as I like my jerky.
