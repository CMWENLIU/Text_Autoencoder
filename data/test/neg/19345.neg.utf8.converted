I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.<br /><br />If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use. It seems pointless to go through the effort of making organic food for your child when the food ends up contaminated with mold or chemicals due to the Beaba's design.
