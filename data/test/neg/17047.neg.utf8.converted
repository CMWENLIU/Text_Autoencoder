I thought these were terrible. I couldn't finish a whole bag. However, the nacho flavor was there. I just thought they were so expensive for the taste. I brought them to work and a couple coworkers like them, but I really don't. They'r not cruncy enough and they feel a little soft. Blah, didn't like them.
