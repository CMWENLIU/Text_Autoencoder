For some reason Good Earth Original Caffeine Free, Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea has switched from Natural flavors to Artifical flavors.<br /><br />For what reason?<br /><br />I didn't buy this tea to consume ARTIFICIAL flavors, or I'd have bought a different tea.<br /><br />I resent the change.  Cancel my subscription.<br /><br />Is this the impact of Globalization or simply TATA Enterprises dumbing down the product?
