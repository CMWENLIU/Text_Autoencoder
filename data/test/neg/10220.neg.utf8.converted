I love many BRM GF products, but this is not one of them.  GF baking is tricky stuff and if you have only tried rice/starch blend mixes, you'll probably love this because it does rise well, isn't gritty like rice mixes, doesn't get "hard" at room temp like rice, and is much spongier.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is still more to want and like in GF bread. First, there is so much bean flour that it's noticeable in the taste.  Seems that some people like this (or don't notice) and others truly detest it.  We're in the detest category.<br /><br />Second, there is actually too much rise in this unless you put it in the oven after a very short rise.  I was making dinner and was about ten minutes late putting it in.  It rose higher than you would think possible, but then collapsed in the middle - not the top, but think of someone sucking in air in their mouth and making that hollowed cheek look.  That makes for a weird shape!!!!<br /><br />Usually, this oddly shaped bread only happens when you either add too much water or when you use a lot of bean flour.  This bread could be so much better with less bean and more sorghum, millet, Montina, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or almond meal.  Probably, with a combination of the above, it would be fabulous.<br /><br />I knew there was this much bean flour when I bought it. I usually make my own and have some delicious recipes.  I try mixes for two reasons: to see if I'm missing anything and to support the companies that go out of their way to make GF products.<br /><br />I've answered my curiosity...I am not missing anything and will not be buying this again.  While too sweet, Pamela's is much better choice if you do not like the beany taste and the odd shape.
