The quality was very good, but I ordered 2 packages of odor free and while I understand they will have a slight odor ( I have ordered odor free from other vendors) these were not odor free and were not labeled odor free.  I emailed the seller and they suggested I air them out for 24 hours.  I won't use the seller again because they didn't attempt to address the issue .
