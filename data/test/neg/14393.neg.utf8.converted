Two times, a week apart, for no apparent reason other than snacking on this product, I became violently ill.  I researched the potential side effects and becoming violently ill is not supposed to be one of them.  I cannot return the bag for a refund (thanks, Amazon) so I have to throw it out.  I will be trying another brand soon.
