We are a dairy free family who use coconut milk as a substitute, so I am pretty familiar with coconut milk.  I had purchased several cans of Native Forest from a retail store and liked it - I use it in my coffee as a creamer.  However, the stuff that was delivered to me through Amazon was completely different that the cans I bought at the store.  The milk is very thin (which I don't mind) and incredibly oily.  I shook the cans thoroughly before I opened them, but you can see the oily floating at the top.  The milk separates when in the fridge with the coconut oil forming a thick layer on top.  There is an odd flavor to the milk, too.  I am so bummed I have to go through 12 cans of this before I can order some Thai Kitchen.
