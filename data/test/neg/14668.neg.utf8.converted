I reviewed these 5lb mini gummy frogs right after I received them about a month ago. It wasn't a favorable review either. I can't believe the last post on this product was over 6 months ago (Sept. 2010). They probably had 6 months of bad reviews...anyway, I'll try again and hope I'm able to warn you about these gummies.<br />Let me first start out by says how much I LOVE Haribo gummies. When soft and fresh, these are definitely worthy of five stars. I love the green frogs and mini frogs the best. Whenever I am at Cost Plus (the only places I find the mini frog gummies) I'll purchase a small 5 oz bag at $1.79. So when I saw the latest deal through Amazon to get 5 lbs of mini frogs for cheap, I jumped on the deal. Yes, I did read all the reviews and saw the one and two star reviews before placing my order. But most were old posts, some years old. They've got to improve their product freshness issue by now, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, what arrived was a big block of hard, stale mini pellets (gummies). I was totally disappointed. Hence, my one star review.<br />For those of you wanting soft gummies. Buy the 5oz - 12 packs. Those are tightly sealed packs and hold in the freshness better than the non-airtight packaging of the big 5 pounder. Not as good of a deal but you'll be getting a fresher product.<br />Would I buy this product again? 5lb package: no. 5oz 12 pack: yes.
