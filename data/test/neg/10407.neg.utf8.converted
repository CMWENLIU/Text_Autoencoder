OK, allow me to make the following disclaimer prior to the review:<br /><br />I have drank a LOT of soda in my life...Coke, Pepsi, RC, store brands, Lemon-Limes, Oranges, Grapes, Cherry, Root Beers,etc., in both Regular and Diet versions of all the above. I generally do not purchase "organic" products b/c of the associated costs, so it might be that if you are likely to purchase this product, you might deem my tastebuds dead anyway. Having said that:<br /><br />A vegan co-worker had a six pack of this product in the office fridge of which five cans have remained for about a week and half. I asked him about 30 minutes ago if he minded if I tried one of his sodas, he said sure, that he didn't care for it, but he could see how others would. Me being a die-hard carnivore, I mistakenly thought his dislike of the product to be a good sign. Wrong!<br /><br />This is not good. It starts off fizzy, then you get the cola taste, then you get some sort of bizarre tannic sort of aftertaste. I couldn't figure out what it was, then saw on the label that one of the ingredients is tartaric acid (from grapes). Ugh. After several more sips, I concluded that the aftertaste is the same as that of very tart, almost sour grapes.<br /><br />I still have half the can left. Slow sipping doesn't help, neither does a quick gulp. I thought Moxie was the most "different" soda I had ever tasted, but I think this has it beat. To each his own, I suppose, but buyer, you have been warned.
