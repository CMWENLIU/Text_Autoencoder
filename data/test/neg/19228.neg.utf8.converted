"Sit, stay..."  Three pairs of eyes look up.<br /><br />I sniff the bag - the smoke scent is overpowering.  My test subjects anxiously await the treats and are more than willing to contribute to this review.  Two black labs and one miniature dachshund all give these treats their unqualified seal of approval.  BUT, they can't read the ingredient list...and I can.<br /><br />The front package labeling claims "bistro beef recipe dog treats", and the back label reads "...bit-o-luv dog treats are made in the USA without any by-products, wheat gluten, artificial flavors or colors.  We even have our beef and chicken inspected by the USDA..."<br /><br />Sounds good, until you read the ingredient list: "beef, chicken, dextrose, water, corn syrup, soy protein isolate, natural smoke flavor, salt, potassium sorbate (preservative), paprika oleoresin and sodium nitrite (preservative)"<br /><br />I think I'll skip feeding my dogs GMO soy and nitrites...and go back to making them homemade treats.
