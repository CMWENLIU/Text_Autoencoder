I ordered the coffee samplers for a christmas gift. I was very excited that received the order really quick. I was expecting it to be in real packaging. Opened the box and found a crumpled up brown bag, hole on the backside with the k-cups tossed in and stapled shut. There's no way I'm going to give this as a gift. There was a good variety if you are buying for personal use, but the packaging dies not cut it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OAZ36I">24 Count K-cup Flavored Coffee Sampler</a> Huge disappointment!
