Switched to this food and several of my cats had the runs.. after a month on this food, my 12 year old cat ended up at the vet's and they couldn't find anything wrong in the  metabolic tests or any other tests but he clearly had lost much weight and was shutting down physically. almost 300 dollars later and having him almost die, i switched back to katz'n flocken. he's now on the mend and his poop is showing form again.<br /><br />I think there's something potentially dangerous with this food.
