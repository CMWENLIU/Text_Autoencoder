AS IN PREVIOUS REVIEW, COSTCO PRICE: $8.99.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved the ORIGINAL Philippine Dried Young Coconut which used to have sulfur dioxide as the preservative.<br />The original version was heavenly. I could go through a bag of the original one in 2-3 days, it tasted that good.<br /><br />However, in the past month - end of June 2012 - they have switched to using sodium metabisulfate as the preservative, and it is completely inedible.  This new version tastes awful, horrible, rancid.  I cannot even stomach the *smell* of the new one, much less the taste.<br /><br />The old and new versions are two completely different products in my opinion!  I'd say the bottom line is don't waste your money on this one unless and until they go back to using the old formula.  (Contact them!)
