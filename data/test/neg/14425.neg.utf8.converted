Sorry to have to write a negative review, but these are terrible.  Much too dry, almost tastes like little rolled up pieces of paper. I tried mixing them in my yogurt, but they were still much too dry.  Don't waste your money on these.  Buy Heaven Mountain brand, as they are the absolute best! You won't believe the diffence, until you try them.
