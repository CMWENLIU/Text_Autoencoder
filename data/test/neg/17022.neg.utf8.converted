Usually, organic food tastes sweeter and is more tender than food with preservatives and bug spray in them.  This lot of Westbrae organic corn I bought from Amazon tasted oddly flat:  very little flavor.  It may have had something to do with the cans having arrived dented, I don't know, or it was just a bad crop, or, who knows if it even was organic?  Disturbingly, the cans were lined with that white plastic that is so controversial.  Does the plastic contain endocrine disruptors that are in the news so much lately?  I don't know.  I probably wouldn't have even noticed if it hadn't been for the off-flavor.  I'm still open to buying organic canned produce, but I won't be ordering this one again.
