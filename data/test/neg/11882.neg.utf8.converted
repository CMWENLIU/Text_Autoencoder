That being said, I don't know if it does work if one does drink it because I just couldn't stomach it.<br /><br />The description boasts a blend of raspberry and acai that is "bittersweet"... Seems to me they left out the tartness of raspberry altogether and bitter is an appropriate word- unfortunately the combination of bitter and sweet equals a taste that is like a nibble of unripe fruit and a packet of sweet n' low/saccharine.  The taste is that foul and bitter.  The other flavors of Celcius seem to have better reviews here on Amazon and those may be worth a try, but raspberry acai is just unfortunate.  My first thought was that that they left the "ai" out of the "acai" (sorry to be crude, but really yucko tasting stuff)...<br /><br />I would like to try the other flavors as they seem more promising but I think I will taste them in one can experiments from a local convenient store and make sure I like them before being left with 23 cans of doorstop.<br /><br />The premise- 100 calories burned per can is quite appealing.  This product is marketed as a supplement. It does contain caffeine, guarana, and taurine, and a few other ingredients in their special blend, MetaPlus.<br /><br />Fingers crossed that one of the other flavors tastes better, as I could also use the 3-hour extended energy boost that the cans claim.
