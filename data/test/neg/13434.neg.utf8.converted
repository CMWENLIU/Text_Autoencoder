The product ingredients should be listed here. It should not say "ingredients listed on packaging".  For those with gluten problems or severe food allergies, we NEED to know the ingredients BEFORE we buy the item.  I'm glad I went to the main web site for this product. It says they contain garbanzo flour which my son is SEVERELY allergic to.  PLEASE start listing the ingredients so that we don't have to go on a hunt all over the net to find out such valuable information!
