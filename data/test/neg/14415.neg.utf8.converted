I just received my goji berries. They taste awful and "old." Not good. They taste like cardboard. And I think the berries have been collecting dust in some storage bin somewhere in China. The only redeeming factor may possibly be that I can at least use some of the seeds of the berries and plant them. Maybe not though, since these berries seem to be old and dusty.<br />What I got was crap. Maybe I'm the exception. Though other people had a similar experience from past reviews.<br /><br />Be Warned!
