This is so good! Great flavor, excellent in salad dressings, too. Definitely will reorder this. A little goes a long way, and it's perfect for frying prawns or fish. In one word: YUM!<br /><br />***UPDATE*** July 17, 2012....<br />This oil is NO LONGER MADE IN FRANCE!! It is made in California, now. It is no where nearly as good, very little hazelnut taste, and not very "roasty" tasting, either. I originally gave this 5 stars, now I'm giving 2 stars for poor quality, and wrong info about where it's made. Very disappointed in Amazon for not updating their description, too.
