Water is good if you're thirsty. Fiji certainly tasted softer, less minerals, less metallic than my tap water at home, but then so does other people's tap water. I was unable to definitively say whether I preferred the tap water or Fiji. 2 stars because in my opinion this is a very over-priced item marketed to the delusional obsessive. It may or may not be better or worse for health than the tap water, since they only list the "good" minerals that are in it...maybe they shouldn't list fluoride. My tap water is deliberately treated to be free of the most dangerous contaminants.<br /><br />Fiji implies (though they don't concretely claim) that this water comes from a CONFINED aquifer and that means it is not replenished by rainfall so there is none of the airborne pollution we have seen in the atmosphere over the last 150 years or so. Of course this means that it will run out, so I guess buy it while you still can! It must have been in the air and through the ground at some point though since that's how the water cycle works, so we must assume that dinosaurs or some organisms have pooped in it.
