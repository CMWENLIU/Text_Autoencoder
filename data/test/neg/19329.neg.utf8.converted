To give you a bit of background, I drink tea every single day, several times a day.  Not your typical American bag tea, but loose tea.  I like the variety of flavors available in loose teas.  I enjoy Rooibos and other herbal teas, White teas, Green teas, and Black teas.  Basically, I should own stock in Teavana since I drink so much of their tea.  I also found a phenomenal tea from Stockholm.  These teas are much better than your standard Orange Pekoe and Black or bagged teas in Starbucks or my local grocer.  That said, this product intrigued me and I figured I would give it a chance.  We only brewed it straight in our drip coffee maker.  No foam and such that was shown on the package...Here are the pros and cons we found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*health benefits - but I get that with the teas I already drink<br />*seems easier to get more concentrated flavor (if you want that)<br />*Cappuccino or other methods could be good if you're trying to replace coffee with healthier alternative (I still would just opt for loose tea since the deep, rich flavor of coffee isn't "there" with this product.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*flavor was ok, a bit heavy, not spectacular (on the other hand, the teas I drink each day are complex, varied in taste, and refreshing)<br />*texture was off - usually I don't think of teas as having much of a texture but there was a definite difference due to the ground nature of this product - felt "off"<br />*It reminded me of how creamed corn is the leftovers.  I wonder if the leaves used to make this were so small they were ground up in hopes of still making a profit.  I could be wrong or pessimistic...
