A previous reviewer mentioned that they could not get these in Chicago anymore because of the plant closing.  Well, if you read the back of the Easter bags, they're all made in Mexico!  The United States is the largest producer of food in the world yet we can't afford a little thing like sugar to make our own candy? I bought a bag before I realized what had happened and didn't know until I had actually finished them.  Wondered the whole time why they tasted differently than in previous years.  Well, there you have it. We're buying our own name brands made outside of America.  Hope they bring this back - they're not the same and Chicago needs the jobs!
