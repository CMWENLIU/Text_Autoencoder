Maybe I got a bad can... because my experiences are so far off from the first two reviewers that somethings must be amiss.  Mind you, that this review is from experiences when this product first hit the shelves, so it's been a few years, but there werent many reviews here, so I thought I'd toss my hat into the ring.<br /><br />I'm very experienced with coffee, I worked my way through high school & part of University in a small coffee house as a barista- back before we called ourselves baristas and before THAT Coffee Co. ("in my opinion"- so I dont get sued like others that have said this) had started tainting the world with burnt coffee so they could sell expensive coffee milkshakes.  Sure we sold tons of espresso & cappucino, but we also sold tons of fresh roasted, ground, and brews o' the day from all around the world- black or with a dollopofmil. It was awesome, I was like a kid in a cand- no, like a kid in a coffee store- which I was! So the moral is that I've got extensive coffee house experience, and my job was producing this Nectar of the Gods in whatever form someone wanted it.<br />  But... I'm also not such a coffee snob to ignore both history, blind taste tests, and the average consumer. I've seen multiple taste tests that puts those massive tin containers of grocery store ground coffee up against coffeehouse/boutique coffee- and seen the grocery store stuff take the prize.  One of my employers is an 85yr old New York Jew that (in what would make the coffee-elitists have a conniption fit) makes an incredible cup o' joe with a an old percolator (against all of the laws of coffee physics) he inherited from a small NY diner... I'm also an accomplished scientist, with one of my specialties being h2o chemistry, which gives me insight into the various methods of brewing, etc.<br /><br />Lets call all the verbose drivel above my Coffee CV. It's meant to show that although I've got a good deal of experience with what one would consider "fine coffee" from the coffee house, I also have a tremendous amount of appreciation for ALL of the wide world of coffee- From an awesome bright estate grown Costa Rican brewed in a quality drip, to a syrupy Yirgacheffe in a press-pot, to Yub@n in a percolator, or M@xwell House 4-cup filter pack in made in the complementary 4-cup coffeemaker in a cheap motels "dressing area"- I can find something in almost all of them that I like, and enjoy them all.<br /><br />Not so with this Simply Smooth product. It was bitter, remarkably bitter. I probably could have cut it with copious amnts of cream(er) & sugar, but I unless I'm drinking a cappucino, I only like a touch ofcream, sometimes a packet of sugar- as an accent to the coffee, not to drown out the bitter notes.  I brewed a few batches, cleaned the coffee maker, tried a french press. Nothing worked.  Just couldnt find anything I liked here.<br /><br />Very disappointing, I had been anxiously awaiting the product, and got stuck with a BIG tub that I hate to see going to waste.  and I'll admit this experience has kept me from experimenting with any of the other (and newer) Low Acid coffee's.<br /><br />I have, however, found myself enjoying homebrew coldbew on occasion- which reads 60-80% lower in acid (pH wise, not flavor profile).<br />I imagine combining some of the low-acid coffees with the coldbrew method might yield some even more desirable product- or it might just yield a very flat uninteresting coffee.<br /><br />Again- maybe I got a "bad" can.  It was during the first week that the product was on the shelf, and I live in a popular test market city, so my tub may have been one of the first off the factory floor, and could have been defective.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.
