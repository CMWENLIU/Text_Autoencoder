Old London melba toast is good tasting if you like small pieces. It is packed loosely in the box and so far out of 6 boxes I've only found two slices not broken into pieces. Nothing like paying high dollar for toasted bread that is basically small pieces when you open it up. They definitely need to work on their packaging.
