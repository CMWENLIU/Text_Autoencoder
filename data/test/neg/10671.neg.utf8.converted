I ordered this item and the next day I tried to cancel it, as I found it cheaper in the store. They hadn't processed my order yet, but they didn't let me cancel anything. When I received the product, the expiration date was close by, ordered it in end March and it will expire in June. How the heck do you use 4  packs of peanut butter in 3 months??? I am truly disappointed in this seller.
