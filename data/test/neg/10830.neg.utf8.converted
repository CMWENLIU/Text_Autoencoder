At first I loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner. It smelled great, my hair was manageable, it curled perfectly. Then my hair started falling out. A few strands extra here and there. But my family starting saying mom your hair is everywheres. Then the clumps started coming out. I have stopped using the S&C the clumps are still coming and I am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower. Hopefully it will stop I really enjoy having hair.
