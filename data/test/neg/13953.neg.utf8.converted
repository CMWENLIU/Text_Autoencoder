I was sent a bag of this with a litter of kittens I am fostering. At first I thought perhaps the kittens were just more interested in wet food, because they wouldn't eat this stuff. Then they discovered my own personal cats' food (a much, much less expensive brand), and they were grubbing on it! My own cats turned up their noses at the Science Diet, too.<br /><br />It may be fabulously nutritious, but that doesn't really matter if my cats refuse to touch it.<br /><br />My dog liked it, though.
