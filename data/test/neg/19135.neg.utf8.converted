This product is supposed to be refrigerated, according to the maker. Not refrigerated after opening, but refrigerated. They claim to ship it to retailers in refrigerated trucks. This is a concern, because it's bottled in #1 plastic bottles, unlike most health juices, which use glass bottles. A concern to me in Arizona, where even in winter the UPS trucks heat up. I received mine late today, and it was quite warm--luckily it was under 100 outside, but on an 80 degree day the insidees of vehicles reach above 102 degrees. So it was somewhere under boiling.<br /> Very bad packaging. They could at least use #2 plastic. The taste is fine but the anti-oxidant effect is bound to be either a wash or negatively affected by the heat. I will have to go back to purchasing another brane from a health food store where they keep it in a refrigerated case.<br />I have an email in to the maker and will post an update.
