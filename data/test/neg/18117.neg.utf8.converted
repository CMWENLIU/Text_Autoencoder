Product Description says:<br /> "It can be substituted for domestic long grained rices for an aromatic touch and special flavor; An aromatic rice"<br /><br />I would say that:<br /><br />1. It is a short grained rice!<br />2. Neither Fragrant nor Aromatic!<br />3. No flavor or taste at all!<br />4. You can find better "Basmati" rice in every local Costco for one third of this price!
