The label says duck, which would lead you to believe it is duck, not turkey.  Well, unfortunately, it is made with turkey.  Therefore, for animals that can eat duck and NOT turkey, this fails to meet that requirement.  I always give a very low product rating to products that label themselves incorrectly.  If this said "with duck" that would be more honest.  Ordering online,  there's no way to know it contains turkey unless the seller includes that information in the description.
