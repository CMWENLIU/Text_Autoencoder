I just uploaded a picture of all the dented cans that I received in my latest shipment. This was the third month in a row that cans arrived dented. Amazon did refund half the shipment, which was great, but this just isn't worth it when some are so dented they are leaking.<br /><br />Too good to be true! Wish this worked because I hate buying cat food at the store and this was very convenient, but I have now cancelled my subscribe and save. Bummer.
