I have brewed the coffee three times and my wife brewed it once, as well.  We tried different amounts of the pre-ground coffee and we could not brew a pot that we enjoyed.  The flavor has the overtones of chemicals, which is not to say there are chemicals in the process used, it just tasted that way.  Little body, low in complexity, and awful in flavor.  I tried one more time this morning and after tasting it once again, threw in ice, foamed milk, and poured the rest of the pot down the drain.  The unopened bag that I have and the opened bag will be disposed of.  I've read all the reviews and the touts of the manufacturer but given my druthers, I'd rather not drink coffee or suffer with the little bit of reflux I get from non-acidified coffee.  This just wasn't worth it.  I wrote to the manufacturer 2 weeks ago to say I was disappointed and asked if there is something that they recommend I do to perhaps improve the quality of the brewed coffee.  I never got a response which tells me a) they don't care and/or b) it is what it is and you will either like it or you won't. I took a chance and unfortunately it didn't work out for my wife and I.
