Just so that I wouldn't have to spend $$$ on Starbucks Chai Tea, I purchased this concentrate. This is the exact brand they use at the store, which I have no complaint about. However, I would recommend ANYONE who has access to a regular store to purchase this at a Wal-mart or Costco. Wal-Mart sells this exact product for $3.76.
