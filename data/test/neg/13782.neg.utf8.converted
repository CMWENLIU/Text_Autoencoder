I HAD BOUGHT THIS BRAND OF TOFFEES AT A COSCO STORE A FEW YEARS AGO.  tHEY WERE THE BEST, CREMIEST, SMOOTH,TOFFEES I HAD EVER EATED.  AFTER SEARCHING FOR THE SAME CANDIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND FELT LUCKY THAT I HAD FINALLY FOUND A SOURCE FOR THEM AND ORDERED 3 CONTAINERS OF THEM.  THE CANDIES ARE SO VERY DISSAPPOINTING, BEING GRAINY AND NOT HAVING THE SAME FLAVORS THAT I HAD REMEMBERED. AND CERTAINLY NOT SMOOTH AND CREAMY LIKE I WAS SEARCHING FOR.
