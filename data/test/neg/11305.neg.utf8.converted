$1500 later......please learn from my experience and DO NOT buy these Himalayan Yak chews for your small dog.  I have a 14lb Shih Tzu who is a chewer and we were turned on to this product by our local high-end dog retailer (Mud Bay).  While the packaging does have some warning about when the chew gets small.....I have to say it's near impossible to babysit your dog's chewing.  A piece of this company's yak bone did in fact get caught in my dog's esophagus and we incurred some SIGNIFICANT bills to retrieve the item through endoscopy.  Not to mention all the pain and suffering my dog went through all because of a product he's supposed to chew on/eat.  It's just not worth it.  The chews in the package are smallish and you'll have to end up throwing nearly 1/2 of it away because it will become a choke hazard for your dog.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!  I hope my review helps you steer clear of this product!
