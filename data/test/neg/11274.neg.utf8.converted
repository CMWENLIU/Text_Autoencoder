I bought a case of these for around $60.00, thinking I am getting some delicious Italian Coffee,<br />the cup is not the right size for the keurig coffee maker and I have wasted my money. I am not<br />sure if this will work in the tassimo machine or not.? I am sure the coffee is probably good,<br />but not when it doesn't work in your machine. They should list what coffee makers support this<br />product. I hope you can learn from my mistake. In the picutre, the cup looks longer than it<br />really is. It is a small narrow cup in actuality.
