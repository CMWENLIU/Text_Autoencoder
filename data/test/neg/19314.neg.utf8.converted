Do not, do not order this product, Friskies Senior Diet Pacific Salmon Dinner in Sauce.  You will not get what you ordered.  They send you Regular Salmon, which my son opened up making it unable to return.  I now have 24 cans of Salmon which my two cats will not eat.  It was a rip-off and had I been able to return the product I most surely would have.  My cats won't eat it and I had to eat 12 bucks.
