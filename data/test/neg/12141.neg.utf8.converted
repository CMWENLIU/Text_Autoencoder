I love International Delight Irish Creme creamer.  If this was just a review of the product, I'd give it 5 stars for convenience and tastiness.  But, as with many other amazon reviews of this product, in all its flavors, and in all the variations of case size, my shipment arrived with only about half of the cups being useable.  ALL of the cups were dented, every single one of them.  At least 40% of them had tears in the tops, or the cups were split, resulting in about 75 cups that had leaked all over the entire contents of the box.  After throwing away the open ones, the remaining 100+ cups had to be washed by hand, one by one.  I thought those were okay/  But, as I used them, I frequently discovered cups that initially appeared to be undamaged, when opened for use revealed about half the liquid was gone and what remained was curdled and smelly.  So about another 50 cups got thrown out.  Due to this poorly thought out packaging, I eventually ended up with about 125 cups that had to be thrown away.  What a waste of money!
