The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and "chewy".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained "stale" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the "treat".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.
