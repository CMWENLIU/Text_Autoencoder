The chocolate covered raisins seemed fine from the packaging, but when I looked at the container, it was a 48 oz jar instead of a 51 oz jar. I tried to send it back for a refund or get a jar that was the correct size for the money I paid, but there was no return option. It was only a 3 oz difference from the original, but I was still disappointed that I did not receive the item I wanted for the price I paid. Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase.
