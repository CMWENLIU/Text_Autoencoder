This stuff is absolutely atrocious.  I'm a huge fan of energy drinks - generally Monster or 5hr Energy are my top picks, but this seemed interesting enough to try out.  The stuff is awful - it doesn't wake you up at all, has no kick, tastes horrible, and worst of all it has made me feel terrible pretty much all afternoon - very bad stomach ache.  I would not drink another bottle if somebody offered to pay me the $20 I spent on a six pack of the stuff.  (Also, aside from ebay feedback, this is the first online review I have written of ANYTHING - nothing has motivated me enough to sign in and complain about it before, ever, and I buy far too many things for my own good.  Hopefully that speaks to how awful this stuff is.)  Buyer beware - you could spend half as much money to pay a stranger to kick you in the stomach, and have the same experience.
