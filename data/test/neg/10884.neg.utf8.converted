The ad-wizards at Nutro not only raised the price on their dog food but also dropped the amount in the bags by 5 pounds.  I am in the process now of switching my dog over to a cheaper better quality product.  You can be sure that the prices will continue to go up because if they didn't hedge against the spike in commodities the first time, they are too stupid to do it a second time either and will be passing on the cost of their stupidity in the form of an even more reduced bag size with an increase in price.  MARK MY WORD.<br /><br />12/20/2009 FOLLOW-UP: I was right.  Price jumped to $60 a bag from the high $30's.  Beware, company is currently being investigated.
