Maybe Havahart wised up & stops listing chipmunks as one of the targeted rodents, but the 2-lb bottle I got from my local Home Depot still lists chipmunks (text & photo) as a targeted rodent and I was duped into getting this.  I used it according to directions & there was no rain/wind for a good 2 days after application. I haven't seen a squirrel since but my chipmunks are ATTRACTED, not repelled by it. So this product (or its earlier ver. still sold by Home Depot) is useless towards chipmunks. It may work well for squirrels from what I observe. I returned my bottle to H.D. today albeit I used 95% of it already.
