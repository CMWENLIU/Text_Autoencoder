I was happy to find this food at my co-op. My long-haired miniature dachund was given to me when he was just over 1 year old (he is still under two) because he was not well cared for. I immediated changed his cheap crap diet to this dry food. He loved it and seemed to do very well on it. After several 6-pound bags which were fine, I bought the last bag a couple of weeks ago. He refuses to eat it. There is obviously something wrong with it, as he is not ill. My friend's dog won't eat it either.  I have also tried the canned turkey recipe (I just found out is made by Menu Foods) and right away he started vomiting white foam in the AM. I immediately stopped feeding it to him and he stopped vomiting white foam. I don't trust this company any more, much as I wanted to like their products.
