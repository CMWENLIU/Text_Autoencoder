There is now a link between Autism and High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I am so disappointed in this product and that they would promote giving this to babies.  It may work for gas but the long term affects could be way worse.<br /><br /> See this link for more details.[...]<br /><br />I do not normally write reviews but feel everyone considering buying this product should know this.  Read the label.<br /><br />Erin
