My puppy loved this product...for about 3 minutes.  Thats how long it lasted before he had chewed a hole in it and pulled out the stuffing, rendering it useless.  Way over priced for the quality.  I wish I had come here and read reviews first, a $2 walmart towel soaked in water and frozen has been a way more durable option, which my puppy loves.
