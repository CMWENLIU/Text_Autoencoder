I decided to give this product a try after reading all of the health benefits. I wanted to try something new and healthy.<br /><br />I cannot stand the taste of this drink. It tastes like very watered down tomato juice. It is just not for me. If you like tomato juice, or watered down tomato juice, then maybe you will like this product, but it just does not appeal to me in the least. (The tomato taste comes from the Pomegranate).<br /><br />The little containers are nice. They have a twist off cap which is also nice. My shipping box was totally destroyed though. There was no tape on the one side, so the box was completely open. The case to the drinks itself was tore open too. All of the juice containers were laid inside the shipping box, since the product box was tore open. I am thinking this happened during transit, but there is no way to tell for sure. I get UPS deliveries almost every day and have never had something arrive in poor condition like this, so I don't know what happened there.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not recommend this product. The flavor was horrible and very bland. Others may like it if they like very bland/watered down tomato juice products or very bland Pomegranate products. You DO NOT taste any coconut flavor at all!
