stupid me I ordered chocolate during the summer months! The bag that I ordered came with most of the M&Ms melted and reformed. Maybe Amazon could put a hold on selling chocolate during this time of year like the Vermont Country Store does. But I guess that would put a crimp in thier profits.<br />We ate them anyway but didnt enjoy them as much. Will not do it again.
