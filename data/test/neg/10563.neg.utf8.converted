This tahini is just wrong and taste awful, I bought this twice (first time tahinis buyer) and my hummus kept turning out weird tasting and just not right, like a chemical-ish taste and smell. I ended up trying a different brand of tahini and WOW, delicious results. This tahini is like the Spam of ham, the imitation crab of crab meat, it just doesn't taste right no matter how much you stir it or try to spice it up.
