I loved this product when I initially received it.  I purchased it to use as a dietary supplement and was pleased to discover that it works wonders on hair and skin as well.  I read the label carefully because I was concerned about whether or not to refrigerate.  The label clearly said that refrigeration was not required.  However, after appx. 2 weeks of using as a daily dietary supplement, I began to notice an awful cramping, nauseous feeling not long after I took it.  It was the sickest I have ever felt in my entire life and I repeated it just to be sure that it was the coconut oil causing it and not something else I had eaten.  Same thing again.  All I can figure is the oil went rancid.  There's no other explanation for why it suddenly started causing me to be sick.  So, word to the wise, consider refrigerating this product.  I've stopped using it altogether because I now associate the smell of it with sickness. :(
