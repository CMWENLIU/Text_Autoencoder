Like other reviewers have stated, the quality varies.  The first three boxes I received were great: smooth, creamy, delicious coconut milk.  The one I received most recently is thin, watery, tastes horrible, and has a layer of coconut oil on top.  If this company does not care about quality control, I will not be ordering anymore.  I'm going to start making my own coconut milk.
