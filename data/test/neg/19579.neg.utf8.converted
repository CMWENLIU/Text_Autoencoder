The price of 43 dollars makes this product over 4 dollars a gallon for this product. I can pick up regular whole milk for a lot less than this.<br /><br />The price was around 22 dollars around July-August 2011  , less than 2 months ago.<br /><br />Buy it at 43 dollars and this product will go up even higher. Or wait until price drops back to 22 dollars.
