I have 3 cats and they are little piggies and none of them would touch these...wouldn't even TRY them. One of my cats will eat just about anything you offer him and he wouldn't even try them. They gobble up the Liv-a-littles dehydrated chicken so I thought I'd try these.  Looks like raccoons are getting these! I do not recommend!!
