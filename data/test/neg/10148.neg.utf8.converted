This mug arrived broken in the box. The insert rim was shattered and the whole thing jammed down into the mug so you couldn't pull it out. There did not appear to be a way to return this item which was the frustrating part. After a lot of poking around on the Amazon web site I sent my concern to the contact us option. I received a prompt email back and after minimal back and forth Amazon offered to replace the damaged product. I appreciate this and even though I had to hunt around to figure out how to get this fixed -- fixed it is!  Cute mug -- I hope my brother is going to like it now that I can give it to him in one piece!
