We received this gift basket...very unimpressed when we opened it...very little product,fancy boxes<br />with tiny amounts made to look big in this basket....the butter cookies were the kind you get at<br />Walgreens in a tin...and they gave you a few in a little box made to look fancy.  The almonds were so salty<br />you could not eat them and really nice that they gave you "one" package of hot chocolate makes 8oz...not even two<br />for you and a spouse or friend...not very professional at all.  Everything was so stuck together with sticky dots that you couldn't set anything down or it stuck to something else. Lots of filler in the basket to make it look<br />full....they need to improve their presentation and products.  Would not recommend.
