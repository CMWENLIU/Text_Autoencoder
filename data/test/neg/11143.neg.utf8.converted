The size of these bully sticks are exactly what had been advertised, which I am satisfied with.  However, out of all the brands I've bought for my dog, these are the absolute worst smelling ones I have ever had in my house.  I don't know if it was just my bag, but they smell horrendous.  After a couple of minutes of my dog chewing them, my house began to smell like cow manure.  Other than that, they are everything they were said to be.  They keep her busy, she loves them, but I will not be buying these again.  Then again, I live in an apartment.  If you live in a house, and have a separate room for the dog to chew these in, or can let them enjoy it outside, then they could be for you.
