I ordered this tree, on November 29, 2006, it was delivered December 5, 2006.  It was frozen when it was delivered, needless to say, it now looks dead.  The box said 2 day air, but it wasn't.  I'm very disappointed with this item.  Was supposed to be a gift. but now it's dead.  Becareful of ording plants in the winter time.  I live in Michigan.  It must have set in the UPS office for a few days in a freezer or something.
