I'm trying to cut back sodium in my family's diet so I thought I try this product out since it received really good reviews.  Sadly to say that it doesn't have any taste.  It just has a spice curry like smell to it and will make all your food smell the same whether you're making American, Asian, French, Italian, or Mexican food.  Skip it if you don't like curry or want a little of saltiness to your food.
