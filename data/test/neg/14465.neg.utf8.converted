and I say that because this product isn't designed for my hair.<br /><br />My father is Caucasian, my mother is Vietnamese.  I have a lot of hair.  I wouldn't call it oily, but in the summer it can look that way if left to it's own devices.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and I have rather heavy bangs.<br /><br />In the Virginia summer, my ends can FRIZZ.  And I dislike it, so when I was given this to try, I thought it would be right up my alley.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there are no directions on the jar, but I gave it a shot.  Let me say this...it smells wonderful!  And I thought I would use it like a leave in hair treatment.  Since it is so thick (someone else said almost like shortening, and I would agree with that!) I used just a bit and coated my hair with it.<br /><br />My hair felt nice as it was drying, but a few hours later it felt heavy, and rather greasy.  I didn't like the way it felt,and I jumped in the shower again to wash it out.<br /><br />The more I looked at it the more I began to think this is not for women with my hair type.  While looking online I did indeed find the product, and it is marketed for African American women.<br /><br />I was very surprised to find that the main ingredient in this is petrolatum.  The same stuff in AD ointment.  WHY would you to put that on your hair?<br /><br />As I stated, it is hard for me to give a proper review as it isn't made for my hair type, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to put AD ointment/Vaseline on their hair.
