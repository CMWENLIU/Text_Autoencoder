Ok you've got to understand I'm into gum. I love Stride gum, some Trident flavors, a couple other sugarless flavors. I had high hopes of this gum because I love Mentos candy.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS. It's pretty much nasty. A very bland overtone with a little sour at the end, and a kinda of unnerving menthol finish.
