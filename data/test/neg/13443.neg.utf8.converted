I've never been a big fan of palak (spinach). However, the major problem with this item is that the palak gravy is too thin and the paneer tastes really bad.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the sodium level in this product is ridiculously high. I bought this product thinking that it would be slightly more healthy compared to other packed-food products but the high-sodium level ruined it.<br /><br />That said, some of the other products by this brand, for example 'dal bukhara' and 'rajma', taste much better. And if you are looking for healthy food, I guess you should be looking somewhere else. Buying some fresh vegetables at the local grocery store might be a good start in that regard.
