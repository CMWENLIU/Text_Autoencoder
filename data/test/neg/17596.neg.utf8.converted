I was SO excited to see the white Velveeta on Amazon. My hopes were that I had finally found a replacement for my hometown's delicious queso blanco dip that I cannot find on this side of the country. I happily spent the $16+ dollars on the only size (2 pack) that they had in stock, and greedily awaited the arrival of what I hoped to become a new tradition. Nope. Wrong.  The "cheese" was gummy, sour and plastic-y tasting. It wasn't even as good as it's orangey yellow sister, the regular Velveeta! So strong and off putting, that I threw it all in the trash.<br />I was telling my aunt this story, and surprisingly she, a huge fan of the same restaurant chain, had this stuff, and had found it a dud as well. Serious bummer. So much potential, and such a disappointment.
