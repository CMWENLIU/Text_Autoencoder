These pods cost way more than ordering through Nespresso. I didn't know that and paid about twice the amount I should have. Also it took 3 weeks to ship. When I ordered through Nespresso it took 3 days. On top of all that, many of the pods were crushed. Some didn't even work they were so crushed. In the end, don't buy the pods here. Just buy them from Nespresso's website.
