My daughter, husband and I tried it.  Her first reaction is that it's too sweet, less fizzy and she didn't want to finish her can.  I tried it and felt a sugar shock coming on, with not much taste.  Hansen's Mandarin Lime is much tastier.  My husband, said "Ugh it's horrible, why did I try it?" and poured it down the sink.  Warning:  19 grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test.  And what's with the rosin?  I thought that is for violin bows.  Some people might be extremely allergic to it.  Finally the label says no refined sugar, but concentrating fruit juices is refining sugar, just a matter of technicality.
