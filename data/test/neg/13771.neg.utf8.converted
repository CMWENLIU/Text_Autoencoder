This gopher trap is designed poorly.  We have gophers and bought this trap online.  The only problem is that the part that should come down and trap/kill the gopher gets stuck with the dirt when you set the trap up.  I'm not sure if we didn't dig down far enough or what the problem was, but the gopher issue was not solved with this product.
