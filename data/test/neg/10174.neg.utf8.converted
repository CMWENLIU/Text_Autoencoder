I have long been a fan of Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps (Sea Salt), and when I saw the Mult-Grain version, I gabbed them up.  Much to my surprise, I noted a sweet taste, and upon reading the label discovered that sugar is one of the ingredients.  I avoid all products with added sugar, and have now posted Glenny's Multi-Grain Chips on my "do not eat" list.  Why add unecessary sugar to a health food or a product that is promoted as a healthy food?  Glenny!  What were you thinking?<br /><br />I remain an avid fan of the original Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps (Sea Salt), and highly recommend them as a healthy snack food.
