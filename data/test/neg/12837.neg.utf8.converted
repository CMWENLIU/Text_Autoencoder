The box it came in was roomy enough, that was not the problem. But something caused a hole in the couscous bag, and couscous was all over the box and other items,the couscous bag should have had a double wrapping to prevent this problem from happening. I have purchased this product before, and I love it. But I think Osem should make more of an effort to keep foods sanitary. This is the reason I gave it only two stars.
