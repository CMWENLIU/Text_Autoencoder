I bought this from Costco for $10.  Being a chocoholic, I've always liked the chocolate hazelnut wafers.  After eating these, they had a disgusting mint like/bitter aftertaste even though they are not mint flavored. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is simply their usual taste.  I will not buy these again.  I will be very surprised if people like this taste.
