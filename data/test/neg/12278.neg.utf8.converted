I agree with the reviewers that this flour gives baked goods a bizarre, unpleasant beany aftertaste. I thought that I had accidentally used an old package, but the exp date is not until next year. I was looking forward to trying a new g-f cookie recipe, and it is very irritating to have to throw these away and to waste the time, energy and ingredients. I tossed the rest of the package. I would advise that you experiment before investing in a 4-pack of this flour mix.
