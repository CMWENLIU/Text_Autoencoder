I ordred this holiday assortment of coffee because my husband loves the eggnog version, which is really tasty, but hard to find when it isn't near the holiday season. This product was listed for $6.99 and I ordered it immediately.  My order for the keruig holiday assortment was canceled a few hours ago, and when I came back to see what happened, the same company is offering the product at almost six times the price!  Why was it offered for the lower priced then suddenly jacked up to over $40?!  I feel duped and cheated.  Don't offer a product at a price you have no intention of selling it for.  This is the first and only negative review I have written.  I usually let little things go, and figure there was a glitch or tech issue.  But, the product was listed at that price for multiple days.  Fair advertising is something I expect from Amazon and all its suppliers.  This was clearly misleading, and very frustrating.  I wouldn't be as aggravated, except I found the same product at a local store today for less than half the cost it is listed at now, but I didn't purchase it because I was expecting this order to arrive soon.  I know this isn't necessarily about the product specifically, but I think it is important for people to see the advertising policy this supplier used was misleading.  I will be buying my coffee supplies from other companies both local and online.  This instance has marred my trust with this supplier.
