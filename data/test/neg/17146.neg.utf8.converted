Having lived in Asia for years and being Asian-American and having been a tea drinker (green, white, oolong, black,pu-erh, you-name-it), I was very excited to try this sampler pack of premium teas.  However, when I received my order, I was disappointed in the freshness of the tea.  Great tea should be vibrant and have the aroma of a thousand years of tradition and pleasure.  This tea smelled flat and only had a faint fragrance...it smelled like grocery store chopped tea leaves in bags.<br /><br />The taste of the tea was also disappointing.  There was no rich flavor, even after the second brewing.  Letting it sit for 10 minutes in hot water was the only way to get any sort of tea flavor out of the leaves and the tea tasted flat and stale no matter how long it was brewed.<br /><br />My opinion is that the tea I got sat in a hot warehouse for a couple of years before it got to me and therefore had all the flavor and aroma cooked out of it.  I won't ever order Heavenly Tea again.
