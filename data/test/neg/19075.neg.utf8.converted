At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now. A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states "satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says "Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore.
