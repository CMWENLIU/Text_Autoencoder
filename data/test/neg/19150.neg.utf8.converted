If you're looking, as I was, for the type of black currants that researchers have found are higher in antioxidants than grapes and may have powerful health benefits, look elsewhere.  It's not so much that the manufacturer is being dishonest as that "black currant" has come to mean "Zante currant" in the U.S.  What researchers studied was the Ribes nigrum species; the common name "black currant" here is just going to mislead you into buying small raisins.  Ribes nigrum is a berry that grows on bushes, while grapes are unrelated and grow on vines.<br /><br />After buying these and finding they tasted a lot like raisins (I should have read the earlier reviews), I did some research in Wikipedia and on the web and finally found a source of real black currants, which I've just ordered.  Amazon has some products that list Ribes nigrum as an ingredient, but doesn't seem to carry the berries, just seed oil, cosmetics, and powders.
