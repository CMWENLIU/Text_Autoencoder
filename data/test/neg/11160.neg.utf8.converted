I noticed when I purchased more of these little boxes that Sunmaid has reduced the amount of raisins per box to 1oz from 1.5oz.  I thought the box looked different somehow but of course there was no mention to alert the consumer of the change.<br /><br />I've always loved these little boxes of raisins too.  Handy to tuck in your purse or lunchbox but I am disappointed in the drastic reduction per box.  Of course the price doesn't change.
