I have fed this food to several of my dogs for years now with no problems.  About a month ago, all the dogs on this food developed chronic smelly diarrhea.  I couldn't believe it was the food since I'd fed it for years.  After $500 in vet fees I pulled the food as a last resort.  Sure enough, all dogs recovered in two days (after two weeks of problems).  I tried feeding it again to my "Mr RockGut" dog (the one who can eat anything).  The next morning he was back to runny stinky stools.<br /><br />I went to Solid Gold's website to check for any recalls and found that as of January 2010, all dry food production for the western states had been moved from their CA plant to their MO plant.  This was our first bag of food from the MO plant.  You can verify that by visiting Solid Gold's website and clicking the "News" link at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />If your pup is on this (or any other Solid Gold dry dog food) and suddenly develops stinky smelly feces, SUSPECT THE FOOD FIRST!!!  Don't waste $500 in vet fees like I did.<br /><br />Oh... by the way... an email requesting more information on our particular bag of Barking at the Moon went unanswered from Solid Gold.<br /><br />If they had warned us in advance of the changes, it would have saved us a bunch of money.<br /><br />We're off ALL Solid Gold products.
