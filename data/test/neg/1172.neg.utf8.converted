The title of this product is "Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Box (Pack of 2)".<br /><br />I naively believed was a pack of two Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Boxes, partly based on the obvious interpretation of the title, and partly because it was way overpriced to be a single box.<br /><br />But it turned out that I actually got a SINGLE box of overpriced Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Box.<br /><br />Sure, the box DID pack two separate BAGS of mini-wheats inside the one box, but that hardly qualifies as a pack of two BOXES.
