I tried this Amazon Grocery as an experiment because they had a $20 off coupon for $50 in purchases.  I know the kids love the Krispies and got them some. The cereal came in a big box, the contents where okay - though dinged around the edges, and the shipping time was a little slower than I usually get for packages.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the food here - but when I compared the cost to the local grocery store I saw a huge price difference. If you can be patient, certain cereals always seems to go on sale and this is one of them. Just yesterday I saw 3 17.5oz boxes for $6.00.  Wow.<br /><br />Since the idea is to save on costs from volume purchasing, the idea failed.  Without the coupon, this food buy was not a good deal at all. One by one I saw all the products offered and all the ones I bought become sale items that were significantly less expensive - we're talking in the 45% range here.  I suppose, if you are in a remote area where the gas cost would eat the savings of finding a good price, this would be a decent service. But anyone in a suburban or urban setting will get a better deal at the Kroger's or Ralphs than this.
