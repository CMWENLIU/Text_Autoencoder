I bought the vegetable soup at a County Fair expecting a hearty and varied vegetable soup.  But the soup is misnamed.  It should be called "potato soup" because that's all that is in it.  This  soup is expensive so you'd think they'd at least include a few veggies.  But no, they'd rather pack in lots of desiccated potatoes to fool the customer.  Save your money.
