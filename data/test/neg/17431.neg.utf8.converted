The flavor is OK, considering it's gluten free, but actually not that tasty.  After eating half a bag, I threw the rest away, because it has hard grain bits - really hard.  I recently broke a tooth biting down on something as hard as the grain bits in this cracker, and the dentist bill was close to $1000.  I'm not going to chance breaking another tooth with these crackers.
