This is what National Pet Pharmacy does to con you into buying a smaller bag at a ridiculous price:<br />I was looking for a 40 pound bag of Science Diet Sensitive Stomach Dog Food.  What I found was that the price Petco and others charge on Amazon and what National Pet Pharmacy charges for the bag plus shipping is almost the same.  So I figure I'll save a couple bucks and go with National Pet Pharmacy.  What I didn't realize was that they have this little trick where they put their 20 pound bag up at a similar price that other sellers sell their 40 pound bag for.  So they price their 20 pound bag (which they hope people will mistake for a 40 pound bag - like me, haha) a couple bucks cheaper than the others charge for their 40 pound bag.  So when you shop around if you're not careful you'll assume they're the best deal for the 40 pound bag at a price a few bucks cheaper.  Then you get the box from them and it's the 20 pound bag that you realized you paid way too much for. I just sent it back but of course now I'm out the shipping both ways.  So much for the hours spent finding the cheapest dog food online.  I'll just go to J&B's from now on.
