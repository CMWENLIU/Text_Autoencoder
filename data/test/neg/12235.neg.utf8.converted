I have never tried this product nor will i ever but for those who are looking to purchase or who do, this dog food (i call it food loosely) is a crime to your dogs. its gross. filled with corn fillers and by-products and a whole lot of other nasty things.Do research on your dog food dont go by what comercials tell you, no one said they told the true.in fact most dog foods you see on television are awful.If you love your dog feed as it should be fed. educate yourself. would you feed your children a life diet of junk food full of atificial flavor,colors, and fullers? I'd hope not but thats what this food is. remember you get what you pay for, and paying so little for that amount doesn't make you wonder? Would you buy a $2 stake? no, you'd wonder why it was so cheap... because it crap! Good food requires dogs to eat less because their getting more nutrients from a smaller amount, so their eat less,poop less, and shed less. their skin and coat recieve more nutrients,they have firmer stool, and their overall body is being takin care of. Some better dog foods off of hand:Blue Buffalo,Orijen,Wellness,Nutro,Natural balance,Castor and pollux. these are just a couple of foods of the top of my head that are holistic and natural, but its important to research and shop around and find whats good for your dog. Hope it helps.
