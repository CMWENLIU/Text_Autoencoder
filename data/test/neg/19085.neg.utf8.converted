These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars.
