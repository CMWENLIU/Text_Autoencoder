Monin syrups are obviously of a good quality. They can be found in coffee shops and restaurants all over the country. Most of them are fairly tasty, if not excellent, but this jasmine syrup is one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  It tastes like soap. It literally tastes like soap. I ordered four Monin syrups at once. Lavender was delicious, hibiscus was pretty good, but both jasmine and guava were gross (guava tastes like cough syrup). Please save your money and try another flavor.
