15 bottles for 30 dollars?<br /><br />CVS, Shoprite, Pathmark, and Stop and Shop all sell it for less. A LOT less.<br /><br />In fact, There is a sale at shoprite now, 10 for 8 dollars. Which is less than half of the price this seller is asking for.<br /><br />Why on Earth is it 2 dollars a bottle? Is this a special version of Vitamin Water Zero or something? Does it do magic? Will it give me sexual pleasure?<br /><br />ROFL at the price.
