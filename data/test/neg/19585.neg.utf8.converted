Is corn the main ingredient or Quinoa? I see this to be good for the folks who need "gluten" free, but I want to eat it for the health benefits. Which one is the main ingredient? Isn't it a label violation if corn is the main ingredient (they list corn flour as the first ingredient)? I need to know! Until the manufacturer publishes that, I am not getting this product anymore! I am afraid to order any more of this brand!
