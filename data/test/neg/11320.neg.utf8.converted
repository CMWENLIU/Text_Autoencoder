I did love the ONE coconut water but my last two shipments (case each)had numerous ones that smelled funky and were very foul tasting. As soon as you tear off the tab, you can smell it has gone rancid. Not sure if it is how long Amazon holds it in their stockhouse, if they even do that, or if it spoiled due to extreme temperatures but I have had to throw out an average of 3 containers from each case. Not sure the word Aseptic is factual when it is so rancid at times. But when they are fresh, it is good with a light taste. Not overpowering.
