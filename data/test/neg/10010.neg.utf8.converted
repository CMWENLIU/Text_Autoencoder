I received this tree on December 17th.  I was home for delivery (it was sent as a gift) we unwrapped it immediately.  The soil was very moist, almost soaking when I unwrapped it, so I did not water it again.  Some of the leaves were starting to curl and blacken, but I assumed that was from shock.  I emailed Brussels directly over that weekend and phoned them on the 21st.  I have yet to receive a reply from either venue.  The tree itself is now about dead, though we have it in direct sun and have been keeping the soil moist.  Almost every leaf is blackened and curled/dried up.  Very disappointed in their customer call back.
