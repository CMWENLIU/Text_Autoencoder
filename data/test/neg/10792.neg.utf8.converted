As my moniker suggests, I LOVE the glorious coffee bean. This, however, has got to be some sort of test....trial by fire-brewed perhaps? At first sight this basket looked delightful. A relatively cheap basket, as is to be expected, filled with goodies. Then comes the unwrapping. The cello wrap was broken, perhaps that is evidence that some sneak removed the 'Jamaican Blend' that is promised but missing.<br />The 'Coffee Box' box was a plain box with a photo copied paper taped to it, which contained 3 Arbuckle single pot bags. The next stuff I am giving a star because of the hearty laugh it gave me...<br />Cafe Vergnano 1882 cookies (4) are ginger-y and a nice complement to the unimpressive but not-too-bad Arbuckle's coffee. The box of 'creamer' contained a few packets of the most generic of office coffee whitener, the brands car repair shops use while you wait to get the oil changed. The 'Sugar in the Raw' was few packets as well. Here is the delightful part. Each box was covered by taped on labels....over empty JELLO BOXES! But wait, it gets better. The coffee stirrers were in an empty Reese's Pieces box! I have this odd visual of rag-clad children being forced to empty Jello and candy boxes day in and day out.<br />If I were the Queen of Back Mountain Baskets...I'd have a ban on scotch tape. I would make sure that the wooden coffee stirrers aren't flavored by the still fragrant Reese's Pieces box. Better creamer or no creamer. I don't mind the diner-esque coffee mug, but perhaps a more trend-on shape would be nice.<br />The individually wrapped cookies/biscuits were quite nice. Perhaps I would add the tiny wrapped bits of chocolate served with coffee in most European cafes.<br /><br />Until all that happens, I think I'd rather have a basket that has the Jello and Reese's intact and original.<br /><br />EDIT PLEASE NOTE: I have been made aware that I received a MOCK UP and NOT the basket intended for Amazon customers.
