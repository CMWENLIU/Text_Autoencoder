I think it might be an error, but believe me 12 bottles of .5 liter Fiji Water is nowhere near 65 dollars...this HAS to be a mistake for real.  The Online Candy Shop itself has the same item on sale for 28 dollars, which is still pricey but MUCH MUCH closer to the real price.  Amazon PLEASE REMOVE THIS ITEM SO PEOPLE DON'T PAY 70 DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT COSTS 30.
