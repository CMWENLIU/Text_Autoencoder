I have rotated between Fiber One and Smart Bran. Today I find that an ingredient in Fiber One is Aspartame. Uh.....No thanks Uncle Don (Donald Rumsfeld is responsible for getting FDA approval for Aspartame, after it's failure to gain approval....do the research, you'll see). I am sticking with Smart Bran. Just one man's opinion. No matter what, it's food for thought..:) Eat as you wish and be happy. May The Source be with you!
