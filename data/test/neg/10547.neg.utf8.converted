I've been a fan of Dinty Moore beef stew for most of my sixty years. That has all changed since they changed the recipe. Now they are adding more sugar. When I first tasted it, I couldn't believe they did that. It tasted terrible and I fed the rest to my dog who didn't seem to care much for it either.<br /><br />The meat also has changed for the worse. It looks and tastes totally artificial. I will never buy this stew again unless they change it back.
