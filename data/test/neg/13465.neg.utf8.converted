First of all, I'm not sure I got what I paid for.  There's a paper label stuck over the imprinted label on the can....two different companies....that was odd.<br /><br />Second of all...I was very disappointed.  NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER!  I had to open 4 cans to use in a recipe, and you flat out cannot taste the blueberries...PERIOD!
