This product is EXTREMELY salty and sweet with an after taste of preservative chemicals. The peanuts taste like what i imagine astronaut food tastes like... completely stale and awful.  I just ate 1/4 of a bowl and had to throw it out.  Everyone in my work area is complaining about the stench... one of them happens to be a Korean girl.  Run far far far away ... simple ramen noodles or even cup of noodles is 999% better than this laboratory experiment of a food.<br /><br />To the people saying this tastes authentic... HUH? Not sure what your definition of authentic is but this stuff hardly tastes like food.
