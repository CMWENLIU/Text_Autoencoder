I bought the jalapeno seasoning thinking it would be a great flavor to add to my popcorn. The good part is that it does indeed taste decent. However, the seasoning is so fine that it makes me cough whenever I try to breath; it gets into my nose and also makes me sneeze. I'm thinking about returning this as the product needs to be improved for me to even consider purchasing another one.
