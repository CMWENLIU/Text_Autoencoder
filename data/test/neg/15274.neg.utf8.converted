Timothy's World is your "average, but nothing amazing" company when it comes to K-Cup products.  This green tea is not much of a change.<br /><br />The flavor is there, but it tastes along the lines of your Bigelow and other cheaper greens.  I would definitely pick Gloria Jeans over this on my personal scale, but it's a nice change in pace if you constantly drink greens and want to add some variety.
