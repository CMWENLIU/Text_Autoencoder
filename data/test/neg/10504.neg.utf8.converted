Well, I can't speak for others who may have had a different experience, but my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012182G">Fresh Whole Rabbit</a> did NOT arrive whole.  No head, no entrails, no paws.  For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store.  Granted, I did go with the "Buy it Used" option, to save a few bucks, which may account for some of the wear-and-tear.  Buyer beware.
