Lindt truffles is my husband's favorite chocolate.  Whenever family or friends take a trip to the US, I always  grab the chance to buy it for him.  In that past, it was hassle-free as it would be a store purchase.  Today is the first time I buy it through Amazon.com where I've had pleasant online shopping experiences in the past.  Today is a different story, I place the order at 2-day shipping thinking it would arrive at my friend's hotel by Sept. 17 or 18 at the latest.  I get an order confirmation email from Amazon telling me that the estimated delivery date would be Sept. 20-21 -- my friend would no longer be at her hotel to recieve the delivery.  So I hurriedly log on to my Amazon account to change the order details, either to make it overnight delivery so it arrives sooner or to change the delivery address.  The Amazon system was faulty and could not display my order.  Heck, it could not display any of my orders in the past year even.  It took two hours and still the website displayed sorry can not display your order.  So I place an international long distance call to Amazon customer service to see what they can do and they say it's not showing up in their system.  Great.  In a few minutes though, they email me saying that it finally showed up in their system and that they can't do anything about it since it's a third party seller (Lindt).  So they direct me instead to get in touch with Lindt.  They can change the delivery details or cancel my order altogether and I can just re-order with the correct delivery details.  So I place another international long distance call this time to Lindt, who says it's not showing up in their system.  They suggest I get back to Amazon.  Which I did and again they re-direct me to Lindt.  Back and forth a few more international phone calls later, Lindt tells me to call back in 3 and a half hours to see if it will be up in their system.  How ridiculous is this??  My bill for this order is just US$40 but I'm spending more on the phone calls just to cancel the freaking order which should not be my problem had the Amazon website been up and running instead of saying it can't display my order.<br /><br />What is more stressful in this entire experience is neither Amazon nor Lindt offered any smarts in problem solving or trouble-shooting.  They did not exhibit good customer service behaviour either.<br /><br />Very, very, very disappointing.
