I have been ordering these for over a year now. Now all bully sticks vary in size, some of these were so big that my shih tzu would eat it in two sessions. I just got a package and they at TINY. Yes, they are still 6 inches in length, but tiny! They about 1/4 the thickness of the ones I used to get. Disappointing, time to find another supplier.
