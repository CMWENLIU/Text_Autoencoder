We ordered Wolfgang Puck Sumatra blend and Columbia Blend after discovering that Senseo brand apparently  is no longer available anywhere.  These two blends were very disappointing.  Neither blend had hardly any taste!  We tried doubling up by using two pods to no avail.  Don't buy this coffee brand....we are now stuck with a 5 boxes of coffee we can't drink!  What a disappointment.
