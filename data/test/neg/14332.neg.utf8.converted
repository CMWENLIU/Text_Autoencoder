One of the bins arrived broken and the brine had leaked all over everything else in the box.  The olives are mushy and way too salty!!! I highly recommend going with the Roland Cracked Green Olives from Greece product available via Amazon too.  Don't waste your money on the Peloponnese Cracked Green Olives!!!
