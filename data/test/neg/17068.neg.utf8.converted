I enjoyed this product for a whole two days, at the end of the day I thought "hmmmmm...this is good...too good...time to investigate with google". What this led me to was a whole lot of information indicating that this product is REALLY REALLY BAD. One of the most striking points is that it has more fructose than corn syrup, can you believe that? They market this EXTREMELY well by making you think that you are getting the sugar from its orginal source without any interference, but a great source states that "The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites". BE WARY. Do a quit search online on this product (brand does not matter) and you will see that it is yet another gimmick geated to the newest health craze. I have emailed a well-known store and this company only to receive a typical "what are you talking about? this is a great product" response i.e. "this makes us lots of money right now, it is cheap to make, but we sell it for five bucks. We get to phillips screwdriver you. We like to do this."<br /><br />This is one of the first websites I found by just searching now [...]  but I have digged and you can too. The information points you in an obvious direction.<br />Make sure to tell your friends and families!!!! I have only e-mailed one store but I think I will come in to talk to the manager maybe not to pull off of shelves but to have an information pamplet next to this product...I imagine if it was pulled suddenly off of shelves people would be all upset and just find a new source...
