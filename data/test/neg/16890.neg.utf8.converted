I was always a fan of Froot Loops and so when I stopped eating all that crap and started eating more healthy I really missed my froot loops.  I came across this cereal at Whole Foods and even though it was more money then I wanted to spend I thought that it sounded very good.  I went in thinking that I was going to get something similar to froot loops but this cereal is nothing like them.  I cant stress enough that if you want to try this cereal dont go into thinking you are going to get a healthy version of froot loops, this cereal is in its own category.  The best way I think I can describe what this cereal is simpilar to would be the taste is more like Trix only not as sweet or flavorful, and they have the consistancy of Honey nut cherrios but much crunchier.  They are so crunchy that it is almost bothersome, to me anyways.  They dont get soggy in milk and are very filling for just 3/4 of a cup.  I couldnt really taste one fruit flavor over the other, to be honest I cant detect any fruit flavor when eating this.  I will not be purchasing it again but I can imagine that children would like to snack on this.  I will be giving this to my newphew, I am sure he will like it.
