It is pretty unbelievable that people use this stuff in lieu of "chemical" artificial sweeteners because it is "good for you"... yet turns your bowels to water.<br /><br />Some say that you even have to "get your body accustomed" to the intake of this stuff.  Use your heads people.  If this has such an adverse effect on your digestive system that you must condition your body to these bad effects, then exactly how "good for you" is this stuff?<br /><br />Luckily I had the chance to try this before buying a lot of it.<br /><br />If your idea of fun is being able to sh__t through a screen door at 20 paces and never leaving a stain, then go for it.  But please refrain from telling me how "good" this stuff is for you.
