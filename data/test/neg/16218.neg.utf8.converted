Original 1 STAR Rating Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />...12/16/2010 Splendid bubble wrapping AND a pristine box condition deceivingly held 4 packages of crumbles. I surmise these were in pretty bad shape before the bubble wrap was applied and boxed for shipment. To add insult to injury packages have BEST BY DATE of FEB0311 ...less than two months away :( The seller would have done better hosting an ice cream social using these crumbles for toppings. I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ... Smaller Version of the Old Time Favorite<br /><br />OMG Still yummy! It was like a stroll down Memory Lane. The coconut flavor carries me back to my childhood in New Jersey sitting on the front steps munching away figuring which adventure us neighborhood kids would be getting into. It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)
