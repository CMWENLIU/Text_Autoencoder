I was really excited about trying this after reading the reviews. On the bright side it is more chocolaty then the Green Mountain Hot chocolate, unfortunately it's not very sweet......in fact it almost has a bitter after taste. I added 1 tsp of sugar and it was much better. If you like creamy, some what sweet hot chocolate......keep looking.<br /><br />note...my wife posted this review.....hot chocolate is hot chocolate to me...that is all.
