Could easily find this in the Wash DC area about ten years ago and loved it.  Since moving to California in 2002 have been unable to find it.  Contacted local distributors and got no explanation why.  Have since learned Canada Dry seems to be playing games with the availability of their diet cranberry ginger ale.  Seems odd a product so popular and in high demand would intentionally be kept from public.  What's the reason Canada Dry?
