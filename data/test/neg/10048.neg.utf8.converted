I bought this salmon, attracted by the "Skinless & Boneless" label (I usually buy the alaskan salmon from Crown Prince).<br />Let's just say that this was a huge mistake. This salmon has 630 mg of sodium per can, and while that doesn't sound like much, the salmon is amazingly salty. If you intend to use it in your cooking, perhaps this would be alright, however, it is impossible to eat as is. This salmon also smells less like salmon, and more like some other kind of fish (which really does not appeal to me much - if I wanted some other fish, I would have gotten it).<br />Basically, right now I'm stuck with 11 cans of salmon that I really have no use for (the first can that I opened made it quite clear that it's the last can I would open). Unfortunately, I don't have a cat. Will look for a food drive to donate this expensive disaster.
