Don't waste your money on these fake white chocolate chips.  They taste terrible and don't even melt correctly.  I bought these to bake cookies for my wife and she always loves the fresh-from-the-oven first cookie.  Well guess what?  Straight out of the oven these chips are still just as solid as when they came out of the package.<br /><br />Next time I will buy real white chocolate from Ghiradelli and will no longer support companies like Nestle who cheap out on their products to make a buck (see Dreyer's with their "Frozen Dairy Dessert" fake ice cream).
