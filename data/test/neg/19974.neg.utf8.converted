Don't buy this chocolate PB2 here. Go to Bell Plantation's site to get four jars for just a bit more. I can't believe the price from this seller. Shop around<br /><br />The product really is amazing. Two tablespoons of chocolate peanut butter for just 45 calories! It's a real treat! Creamy with good peanut and chocolate flavors. I like the chocolate PB2 better than the plain PB2.
