I received my order promptly and as promised yesterday.  My order included a hotair popcorn maker as well as a 4 pound container of Snappy Yellow Popcorn.  I was so excited when I received my order that I quickly opened the box and popped up my first big bowl of popcorn and boy was that a disappointment.  The new popcorn maker worked perfectly but the Snappy popcorn is stale.  I don't normally like to complain but the product was pretty bad.  On a good note, the popcorn pops up big, fluffy, and yellow.  If the popcorn wasn't stale it would probably be quite tasty.  There is no expiration date on the plastic container so I'm not sure if I possibly received a bad container. Perhaps if the container had plastic wrap around the lid or across the top under the lid it would keep the popcorn kernels fresh.  I haven't decided whether I should return the Snappy popcorn container or not but I wanted let others to know. Perhaps it is my fault because I didn't read the specific reviews to include the high and low ratings of this popcorn.  I just saw the overall rating of the popcorn was quite highly rated and highly recommended. My advice, read the reviews (good and bad).
