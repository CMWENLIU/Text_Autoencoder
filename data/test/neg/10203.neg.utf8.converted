When I was growing up, every year just after Thanksgiving, our home would be filled with multitudes of boxes from the Swiss Colony. From cheese spreads, meat logs, candies, and most importantly, the petit's fours! I remember Swiss Colony Petit's Fours being much larger, tastier and not dry as stale cake that has been sitting around for months before shipping. I was very disappointed in the flavor and quality of these little cakes and they are not at all the quality I remember growing up. It has been about 14 years since I had anything from the Swiss Colony and I have to say, it will be the last time I order anything from them. There are so many companies out there now that make them bigger, better and fresher (I know, I picked up a box from a famous brand at a local mall kiosk) than what I had when I purchased these. Granted, the price was cheaper...but I guess I got what I paid for. Very disappointed Swiss Colony!
