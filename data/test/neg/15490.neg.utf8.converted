I didn't look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats. They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back. They are a hard, crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity. While they smelled great and have some quality ingredients in them, for me it just wasn't worth taking that chance when there are lots of other great dog treats out there, where I won't have this worry, to get instead.
