I purchased this Balsamic Vinegar hoping that it would be similar in taste to D.O.C. qualty, 12 year old vinegars. I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.<br /><br />There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.<br /><br />Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase..
