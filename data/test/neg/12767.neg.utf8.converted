I received Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps today.  They were delivered by the U.S. Mail and they are so hard, that even the mail carrier did not crush them when they were stuffed in my mail box.  I did not expect the cookie to be so hard and have a burnt appearance.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these cookies because I do try to buy organic products when I can.  However, these cookies had a strange flavor that lingered long after I finished one.  The ginger is just overpowering.  My tongue is still tingling a bit.  Maybe it is just me because other reviewers have given this cookie high ratings.<br /><br />I think that Newman's Own Organics makes some wonderful items, but this is not one of them.  I will buy Nabisco Ginger Snaps next time.
