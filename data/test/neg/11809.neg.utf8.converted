I love Lipton's Mixed Berry and Orange Passionfruit Jasmine green teas, so I was very excited to see these new flavors.  Not being able to decide which to try, I bought all three.  Couldn't wait to brew up a cup of Red Goji and Raspberry.  Noticed there wasn't a lot of fragrance when I opened the bag, but thought well maybe it'll release when brewed.  Blech!  What a disappointment!  The predominant flavor is strongly the bitterness of green tea.  Since then I have tried all three of these new "Superfruit" flavors and I am extremely disappointed in every one of them. The Purple Acai and Blueberry one has the most fragrant smelling teabag, but the results are just as disappointing. Despite all the hype and the pretty packaging, there is very little flavor to any of these except for the green tea flavor.  Looking for someone to give this stuff to, because I really won't drink it.  By the way, I drink a lot of tea and a lot of different kinds of black, green and herbal teas, and I do know Earl Grey from Irish Breakfast and rooibos from chamomile and yerba mate'.
