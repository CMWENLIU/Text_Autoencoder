The way the description reads it should be a case of 12 boxes with 20 individually wrapped sticks in each box (equaling a total of 240 sticks).  Instead the item I received is one box with two cellophane bags in it.  The facts on the bottom say a serving size is 4 pieces with about 24 servings (equaling a total of only 96 sticks).  Needless to say I feel like I got jipped.  Had planned to add a box of 20 as a sort of "stocking stuffer" with gifts for Christmas - don't know that it will quite work as I had planned the way they are.  Plus only about half the amount it should have been for the price.  I love Bogdon's reception sticks but don't feel I got my money's worth or the correct packaging.  Receipt of item was timely.
