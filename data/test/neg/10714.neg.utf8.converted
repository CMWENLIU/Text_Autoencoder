This is a good but unremarkable toy for the very light chewer in your life.  It's basically just a fabric bone that you soak in water.  The bag you're supposed to store it in broke when we tried to take the bone out after freezing it. It doesn't have any vanilla smell as they claim.  And after the first use our moderate, non-teething dog had ripped out most of the stuffing, rendering it useless.<br /><br />The idea of a frozen toy is a good one, but freezing some knotted up towels would be just as effective. Don't waste your money.
