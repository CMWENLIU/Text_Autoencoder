I just bought these Cinnabon Candy Canes today because they looked unique and tasty.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that these are the worst candy canes I've ever tasted.<br /><br />They SMELL absolutely fabulous....like they should be foodie fan's candle or air freshener. I would even stretch as far to say that they SMELL like a good attempt to be a cinnamon roll.<br /><br />The "taste" is pitiful. I say "taste" because there is barely any flavor....all of the "flavor" is from the scent, and not actually in your mouth. It's hard to describe...it smells like it would be delicious, but completely lacks flavor.<br /><br />Save your money, or buy regular butterscotch candies if you want a creamy, baked-good type candy, which would be 100 times better than these candy canes.
