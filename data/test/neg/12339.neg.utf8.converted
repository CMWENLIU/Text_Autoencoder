This product is definitely not for diabetics, or anyone watching their weight (which most cardiac patients are supposed to do).  It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving).  Salt is somthing cardiac patients are supposed to restrict, or at the least, limit.<br />I also noted an undesirable thick waxy coating left on the roof of my mouth.  The coating is tasteless (not the candy itself).  One other side-effect I noticed is constipation.
