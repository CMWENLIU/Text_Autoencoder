I have been consuming seeds for years. I grind flax and sesame seeds in coffee grinder and add cocoa with soy milk for high mineral contents and antioxidants which is a necessity for my healthy diet. Organic is the best for me and I am amazed why Bob does not carry one since I consume Bob's quinoa, flax seed, etc. and all those are organic. I consumed one bag of this then immediately changed to organic years ago. What is so disturbing is that not only Bob will not produce the organic but his followers/(possibly associates) will rate anyone who says anything true but not favourable negative. Talking about politics. wow... I will consume organic regardless of story line that Bob gives on the phone.
