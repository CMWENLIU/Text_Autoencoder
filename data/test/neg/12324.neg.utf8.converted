My first hint that I might not be re-ordering was the caution on the package to "wash hands with soap and water" after handling the treats. I've never seen that before. Hmm. The things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side-show of the treat world. They smell strange, and look like butcher-store offal.<br /><br />I understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals, but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as "food." There were some bits (unidentifiable) that the dog would not eat, though she would eat most of them. She doesn't seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat, though.<br /><br />And I don't like carrying a few in my pocket on walks, because some are great big tube-like things and some are tiny stick pieces. And of course then I spend the whole walk wanting to wash my hands. It's just a strange, creepy assortment, and I don't think I'll be getting this product again.
