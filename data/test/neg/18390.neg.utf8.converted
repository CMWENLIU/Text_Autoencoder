I ordered this from Amazon and it was fulfilled by Olio2go. The bottle that came wasn't the 12 year aged vinegar. It was some cheap substitute instead that was runny and no better than the balsamic I can get at a convenience store. I don't know if the item is simply incorrectly stocked or if Olio2go is truly trying to pass off this terrible imitation for the real stuff, but order with caution.
