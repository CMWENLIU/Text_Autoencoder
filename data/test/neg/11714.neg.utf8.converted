I contacted this company regarding a recent purchase because I was unsatisfied. I ordered some flavored tootsie rolls - although I was happy with the shipping the quality was lacking. It was a 3 lb. bag and all of the candy was hard/stale. I emailed the company directly and was granted no response. I would not recommend this company.
