I just spent time in Greece last month, one of many places I visited along the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea.  I was also in the Middle East (Israel).  And I can tell you, this does NOT even compare to the real stuff.<br /><br />This Baklava is very, very dry and very conservative on the quantity and quality of ingredients.  It lacks flavor big time!  And the pieces are so small they are bite size.  The nuts are minced so fine you can't even tell they are nuts.  Instead it's like a dry, pasty filling with little flavor.<br /><br />In Greece, the pieces are large (huge compared to what you get with this), overflowing with the moist, nutty filling, very flavorful, with lots of honey, spices, and phyllo.  I had Baklava purchased at a bakery on Patmos Island, Greece that blows this Baklava out of the water by far.<br /><br />I won't be buying from here again.  I'll keep looking elsewhere.<br /><br />I gave two stars for packaging and speed.  If I only had to rate the product itself, it would've gotten zero stars.
