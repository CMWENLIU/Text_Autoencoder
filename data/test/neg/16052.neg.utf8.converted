I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter (at least the Fall 08 bottling).  The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil.  Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch.
