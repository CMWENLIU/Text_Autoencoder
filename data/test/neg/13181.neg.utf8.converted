I couldn't tell if these were tomatoes or strawberries, so I ordered Just Tomatoes Just Strawberries, 4-Ounce Tub, and I'm not sure what I got.  Whatever they are, there's none of that sweet juicy fruity goodness you find in both strawberries and tomatoes.  They should call these...Just Something Dried Up That Just Used to be Fruit or something like that.
