Ortho needs to go back to the drawing board on this product.<br /><br />I have had nothing but problems with it and it's a complete waste of money and a huge aggravation. The yellow part that you screw the hose into pops off while you are using it causing spray back! The red cap that keeps the water shut off until you are ready to use..also pops off mid use. This product is so frustrating!!!!<br /><br />I'm also not sure any of the solution is coming out of the bottle because it's still full and I've used it every day and am covering my yard,around my house, garden beds in this stuff yet..it feels like it's only spraying water.<br /><br />In addition, when I pulled the instructions off the back the pages were stuck together and impossible to pull apart to read.<br /><br />This product is a complete Failure in design from end to end.
