This is a large amount of matcha for the money. The catch? It's not the best quality. Seriously. If you're used to a higher quality like DoMatcha, you will be really disappointed in this. It is quite sour and briny compared. However, it is good 'backup' matcha to have on hand in case you run out of the good stuff.
