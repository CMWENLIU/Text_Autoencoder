I went through the process of ordering directly (not through Amazon) a $29.99 arrangement from this company, only to find that the cost of my original order with delivery and extra unanticipated charges was going to be $70+.<br />The only thing that saved me from this price inflation was my not clicking the "confirm your order" directive. There was no option anywhere for canceling the order!
