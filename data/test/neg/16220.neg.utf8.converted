The item shown on the page is not the item I received. The item I received is the kind of soy sauce that they have in restaurants - the ones that don't have a screw cap but rather a small hole on each side for pouring. In other words, you can't close the bottle. I bought it for the purpose of transporting after using it, but it's not possible. Fortunately, the person I bought it for doesn't mind, but beware that it is not the actual item they show on the buying page.
