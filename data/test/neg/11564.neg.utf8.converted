This gadget is a great idea, and it does indeed avoid most of the mess associated with plain-ground-peanuts peanut butter.  It's also made in USA, a rarity these days.<br /><br />I just wish it worked.<br /><br />I tried it a few times.  Durned if I can figure out how all these folks writing glowing reviews are using it.  No matter how long I crank it, the best I can get is runny, oily PB at the top and thick, unspreadable-when-cold PB at the bottom.<br /><br />The problem is that on the store shelf (or mine), the oil floats to the top of the jar, and the peanut mass sinks to the bottom.  However, the mixing rod just stirs the PB round and round.  There's nothing on this mixer to mix the stuff vertically, nothing to pull the peanuts up and/or push the oil down.<br /><br />It needs something like what my old electric-drill paint mixer has - vanes at a 45 degree angle that turn the cranking into forces that act vertically.  Of course that would make it harder to clean, but at least it would work.<br /><br />I've gone back to the old method.  I dump the jar's contents into a large bowl, mix it up (using that vertical folding motion!) with a big old wooden spoon, then glop it back into the jar.
