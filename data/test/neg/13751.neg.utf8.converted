I think I'm pretty well-qualified to comment on the taste of coconut water, having been drinking it since I was a young on visits to India.  Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst.
