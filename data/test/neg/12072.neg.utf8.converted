Wrote a review several days ago about the bad packaging and the deceptive photos. The seller contacted me and now, to all my surprise, my previous review is GONE! Absolutely outrageous.<br /><br />The taste is just average, not paticularly good nor bad. I have to be honest about this. But there are things that are just as important as taste when it comes to food.<br /><br />The green tea powder arrived in a small aluminum bag with a print-out label sticking to the back. The label looks like it came out of a home-printer. Not enough information are there on the lable, at least not the nutrition information which btw is required by USDA. What's even worse, there is no tin coming with the bag, while the photos clearly show a little green tin. I'd call it deceptive and misleading.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would've given it 2 star if the aluminum bag was re-sealable, but unfortunately, it is not. I had to pour all the green tea powder into another tin. Not worth the $$$ I paid.<br /><br />All are my honest opinions. And please do save this one as my last review magically disappered somehow.
