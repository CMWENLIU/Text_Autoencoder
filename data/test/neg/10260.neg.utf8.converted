Let me start off with the coffee itself which is pretty good. I will say that these coffee's (green mountain and such) have really huge swings. I've bought cases that were wonderful and the next will have a burnt aftertase or be noticably weaker in comparison so realize that these reviews may be reflective of the wild inconsistant nature of the brand...<br /><br />Now for the major point; 1.04 a cup!? I know K's have gone up quite a bit recently but not that much geez. This brand is a staple at "Bed Bath & Beyond" so you know and is 10.99 up from 9.99 for a box of 18, which is .61 a cup. But hey if ya don't wanna leave the house go for it. Oh wait you can order if from them online as well... oh well I tried gimme my star back.
