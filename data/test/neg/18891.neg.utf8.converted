I gave a 5 star review a year ago. This is my new review as of Dec 1, 2011<br />I have been ordering these nuts for over a year now. The quality has deteriorated so much. The last batch had very small and chewy nuts (not like their usual size - large and crunchy) and somehow they tasted strange. I looked at the review and found there were others with the same comment. I am hesitant to re-order from this company again. For this price, I do expect to get the BEST Brazilian nuts.
