I originally gave this item a glowing review--my dog loved it and it seemed a safe choice for his vigorous chewing. Unfortunately, having just taken my dog to the vet with a cracked tooth that had to be extracted, I must retract my original recommendation. My vet had just seen another dog that same day that also broke a tooth using an antler chew. My vet recommends rope chews as a safer (and softer!) alternative.
