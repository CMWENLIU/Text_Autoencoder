My wife and I use Similac Advance. It was recommended by our pediatrician and our infant has no issues with it. As far as we're concerned, it's a perfectly fine product. The reason I'm giving this only ONE star is because of the ridiculous price. I don't know who the pricing genius is for this product but selling 6 packages for $130 makes no sense. I live in downtown Seattle where prices are generally a little higher than most places and even I can go to my local store and buy this same size tub for about $20/tub. Why would I want to pay more for a package that makes me buy in bulk? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?<br /><br />Whoever is in charge of pricing, you really need to do a better job.
