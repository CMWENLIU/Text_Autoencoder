I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this "espresso".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.
