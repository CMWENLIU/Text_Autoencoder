I really like Miracle Noodles but was disappointed by this variety. There was no garlic or herb flavor.<br />The directions include the same rinse and parboil steps as the other varieties, doing it for a shorter<br />time, and maybe that is what washed away any garlic/herb taste. On opening the bag, there was the usual fishy<br />odor but no garlic smell then either and with that odor I cannot imagine skipping these steps. Also, these are<br />the fettuccine style and I prefer the spaghetti or angel hair type. Some people might also find the color<br />unappetizing--a dull greenish brown, kind of like ripe avocado skin or baby diarrhea. I will stick with the<br />other varieties.
