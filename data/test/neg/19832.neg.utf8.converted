Well, it's my fault. I am so used to K-cups (from Amazon) coming in 2 24 cup orders, I assumed that the Green Mountain was the same. NOT! That makes this about twice the cost of every other brand. The coffee tastes pretty good, not great. There are too many other options like Van Houtte Spicy Mayan Chocolate or Cr&egrave;me Caramel, and when you subscribe they are less that 50 cents a cup. Anyway, I learned to be more careful. Buying this once was worth the lesson, but not the coffee. Just my two cents, of which I have fewer now :)
