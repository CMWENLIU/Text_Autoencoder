I ordered this because the reviews were all so positive.  I received the order promptly and when I tried the coffee, I was very disappointed.  Flavorless to the point of being worthless.  I made a couple of batches (I got the whole bean) and I and my friends all agreed it was worthless coffee.  BUT I called the Camano Island people directly and they were very nice and offered to send me a fresh batch.  The guy I spoke to (Dan) was very helpful and he gave me a very positive impression of the company.  My guess is that Amazon just sent me some stale coffee and the fault lies with them, not this company.  So the point of this review is, if you order this coffee and find it stall, try getting some directly from the company and perhaps you will be happier.
