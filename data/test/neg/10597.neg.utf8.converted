We received a flyer in the mail -- an assortment of foods, beef, pork, and these really awful stuffed sole with crab and scallops. Well, like a dummy, I bought the deal.<br />So, perhaps the truth on Omaha Steaks: The sole stuffed with scallops and crab is really a shread of sole stuffed with a paste which I am hesitant to describe. It is not good to eat.<br />When our package arrived, we selected two filets mignon, two sole stuffed with scallops and crab, and four potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were edible.<br />The beef tenderloin was too thin to grill, but we grilled it anyway. Awful. I have already commented on the sole.<br />Still angry 12 hours later (color me stupid does not sit well with me!) I re-read all the information Omaha Steaks had sent us -- and conformed my suspicion that no where do these people state the grade of beef they sell.<br />The quality of the sole stuffed with scallops and crab is perhaps compatable with a very cheap diner on the interstate -- "Well, you are hungry. This is cheap. You thought it might be good/interesting" OK/ We have all made those mistakes on a long road trip -- but to buy this kind of nasty food to serve at home  -- I don't think so.
