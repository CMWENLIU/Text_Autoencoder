I loved the idea of these lollipops, since we have had some big problems with my 5-year old and tooth decay.  She has a crown on one tooth, and the lollipop instantly stuck to the crown, with a very upset child!  I used some water to extract the lollipop, but we will not be using these again.  They may be suitable for kids without crowns, but I imagine they will still be very sticky to teeth.
