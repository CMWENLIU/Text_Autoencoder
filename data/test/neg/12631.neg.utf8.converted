Bitter, bland and essentially bad.  That's what this coffee tastes like.<br /><br />It smells nice when you open it up, a chocolaty mix of coffee and cocoa, and it fills the room with a pleasant smell while you're brewing it.  It almost smells like a chocolate shop where someone is running a nice pot of coffee in the back, giving the whole place the aroma of a winter's morning in Geneva or something.  Gevalia is supposed to sound Swiss, right?<br /><br />Too bad it's Swedish.  Not Swiss.  And a good thing too, since this doesn't taste so much like a chocolate coffee as it tastes like someone stuffed your coffee maker full of truffles and ran some stagnant water through the pot.<br /><br />The best quality of the coffee is that the flavor is weak.  You have to really overfill your pot to get a strong sense of the flavor, but I would advise only doing this if you want your mouth, coffee cup and everything you drink for the next few days to taste like an old sock that someone might have once dropped into a puddle of spilled coffee and then sprinkled with stale chocolate chips.<br /><br />A normally brewed cup of this coffee has almost no flavor aside from the bitter sting of really bad generic coffee.  Once you amp it up a few notches you can really feel the caffeine, so I guess that's a perk at least.  If your hands are steady enough to drink a whole cup you'll enjoy the burnt flavor of the beans along with the sickly sweet chocolate flavor that is thrown in almost like an insult.<br /><br />Stay away from this coffee.  Even worse than the mail-order stuff Gevalia will try to scam on you for a free POS coffee maker, this stuff you have to pay extra for and you really pay the price of your stupidity if you drink it.<br /><br />It isn't that bad as a room scent though, so if you have an extra coffee maker laying around you could set this up to brew while you microwave almost any instant coffee that will taste better than this.  The smell will fool people into thinking that you're a real coffee expert, and it might even enhance the flavor of the instant through a synesthesia effect.<br /><br />Afterwards, you can take the brewed coffee and use it for cleaning old paint brushes or degreasing an engine.
