I just don't get the rave reviews this is getting. A more truthful product name would be "Bay Leaf Soup", because that is the only flavor I can distinguish.<br />  Pick out a carrot and eat it, pick out a potato and eat it, tomato, celery, it doesn't matter, there is no individual flavor to any of it. A spoonful of the broth alone taste exactly like a spoonful of carrots alone, and that is predominately bay leaf.<br />  To each his own I guess, but I just don't get it.
