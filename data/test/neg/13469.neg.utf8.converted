I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear. Luckily I only given about 10 pieces in the week that I purchased the jerky. I immediately stopped giving him the treats since that was the only new item introduced. Lucky for me, my dog was able to recover from the issues brought on by the jerky. Don't ever buy anything that you can ingest which is made in China. Or better yet, just don't buy anything made in china.
