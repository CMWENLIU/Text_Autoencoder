Let me begin with there is nothing wrong with the candy--just the price.  It is not specified in the description but these are the mini smarties rolls.  Most smarties contain 15 candies per rolls.  These contain only 10.  A box count of 120 (of the 15 candies/roll) can be obtained for half this price from other non-Amazon vendors.  I should have done my homework.  Most expensive smarties I ever ate.
