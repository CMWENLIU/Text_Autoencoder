I tried these based on the good reviews and had someone bring me an entire 6 pack of them (I live in the developing world and try to get processed foods brought by visitors)... I am SO disapointed I wasted money and suitcase space on these! Can't even eat 3 bites. The sauce is like concentrated super salty soy sauce with wierd playdough noodle Couldn't taste anything but the soy sauce. If you're tempted to try them, at least buy 1 and not a whole pack until you decide if you like them.
