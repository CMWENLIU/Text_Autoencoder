Too grainy and not a distinct coconut flavor. I was expecting a coconut milk consistency for frozen deserts, coffee and soups. Too much oil in this product to use in coffee and too grainy for soups and deserts.  It may be good for baking, but I haven't tried that as yet. I do like the fact that it is condensed and you add water to it, good packaging.
