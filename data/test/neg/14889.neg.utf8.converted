Received this as a gift, and it was pretty good so I went online to order another bottle.  I was astonished that anyone would have the gall to ask $21 for a regular size bottle of syrup.  Seriously, this is crazy talk.  Yeah, it's pretty tasty, but you would have to be an idiot to support these clowns in their attempt to pick your pocket like this.  In Hawaii, the exact same article is about $5 and targets tourists, because anyone who truly wants this would just make some from scratch.  It's not hard, the ingredients are easily available at any grocery store, and home made does not have the chemical aftertaste.  It doesn't even take long to make, and you can easily have it done, fresh, if you start the same time you begin to cook your pancakes.  You are not doing anything else except waiting for the tiny bubbles to form and start to pop, anyway.
