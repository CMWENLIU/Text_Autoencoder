I've been drinking and enjoying the Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut since I purchased my Tassimo machine a year ago, and would routinely buy it in 2 and 3 packs from Amazon.  I recently noticed that the packaging had changed, but assumed it was packaging only.  I was wrong - the coffee in the new packaging is made with a new "formula" and it is HORRIBLE, overly sweet and artificial tasting.  You can't even taste a hint of coffee flavor.  Stay away from this blend!<br /><br />My hope is that this is just an issue with a production run or this blend, and the other redesigned Gevalia t-discs actually taste like coffee.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called Tassimo Direct and complained about the new Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut t-discs.  They were nice enough to offer me a refund/exchange and I went ahead and ordered replacement t-discs in a different blend.  I hope these will work out much better.  I encourage those that are unhappy with this new product to call them, voice a complaint and get a refund/exchange.
