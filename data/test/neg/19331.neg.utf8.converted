This is a premium Rooibos herbal tea (with no caffeine) marketed as red espresso. The manufacturer recommends preparing this using an espresso machine but I prepared this as regular tea and it works great. It is good quality herbal tea that is rich in antioxidants that are known to scavenge tissue damaging free radicals. The health benefits of these compounds should persuade a health conscious person to try this product. Priced at $[...] for a pack of 2 (8.8 OZ each), I would say it is pricey for two bags of herbal tea. Other websites marketing herbal tea sell similar product at a much lower price.
