The ad for this product is unclear. The picture shows COARSE sugar, not sanding sugar. This is noted a couple of times in the description, but unless you read the whole thing it is not clear what they are sending. It's also unclear what quantity they are shipping. What you get for $8 plus shipping is basically one pound of sugar...about two cups worth. I suspect there is some place where one could get a better deal.
