At the end of the day I am a fan of the flavor that is "ginger".  Ginger has a taste that is both smooth yet has a zing, which makes it very versatile for food.  It has found a home in the realm of Asian cuisine, the ginger man cookie would be lost without it and nothing says "adult soda" like a glass of ginger ale.  And this is only the beginning of what you can do with ginger (root).  Yet it must be remembered that a little can go a long way.<br /><br />This brings us to this "ginger snap" cookie by "Newman's Own".  In a word I would have to describe this cookie as "awful".  It is too gingery, to the point that my mouth feels like I just ate too much hot sauce once the cookie is chewed and swallowed, in other words bad after taste. The cookie has no balance in flavor; it is just straight up ginger, a sweet aspect would be nice. If I wanted to experience that much ginger I would just chew on ginger root. The cookie itself is as hard as a rock.  I was actually concerned I might chip my teeth when biting into this cookie and this is no hyperbole.  Not to mention that the back of almost every cookie in the bag were burnt.<br /><br />The bag itself is very small and the cost is rather high for what the product really is.  This cookie is also made with organic ingredients.  The one category of food marketing that fails to impress me is organic foods.  For the most part they aren't any healthier and are way too expensive.  So at the end of the day I would suggest on passing on this cookie and go for an old school Pepperidge Farm ginger man cookie.
