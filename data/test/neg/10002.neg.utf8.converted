The coffee pot lids are not standardized.  The supplier was quite helpful but the first lid was too small for the pot and fell off,the replacement lid was slightly too large and stuck in the pot and could not be removed.  I was sent a second ensemble, pot and lid, and this time the fit was adequate. But the product itself is incompetently made.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QY9YDY">Melitta Porcelain Manual Coffee Maker</a>
