I will not buy these chocolates again. You only get 15 TINY, LIGHT pieces of chocolate so the price is absurd. The taste deserves 4 stars, but the price deserved minus 10 stars. I will continue buying xylitol sweetened chocolate bars from Nature's Sunshine. Those are also expensive but end up being much more affordable than this Xyla thing. This is a ripoff. The shipping charges from Xylitol USA are also absurd.
