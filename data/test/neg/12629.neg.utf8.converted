I normally like Gevalia coffees and with this flavor, the coffee portion itself is good. The chocolate portion is in itself a little bitter and the bitterness seems to get a little worse as an aftertaste. Gevalia unflavored coffees have always received a positive response from me, but i will stay away from their flavored coffees if this is any indication.
