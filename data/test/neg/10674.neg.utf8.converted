This is an excellent coffee but unlike Amazon's usual great service whoever they use to fulfill the coffee orders is terrible.  I ordered several boxes of this coffee from Amazon but they were shipped to me just thrown in a box.  Anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of the cups were damaged and unusable.  Worse yet Amazon won't take a return since it is a food item.<br /><br />In summary, buy this coffee, just not from Amazon.
