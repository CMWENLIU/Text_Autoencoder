This product tasted off, like it had melted and then resolidified, and also stale. On investigating, I found that the best used date was last year. I have followed the procedure to notify them that I wanted to return it. I needed to email them to get a Return number. The website stated that postage would not be reimbursed. I think that was around $16.<br /><br />I emailed on Wed.  Got a response Sat saying she was just leaving the office but would send me my return number on Tuesday. She said my money would be refunded after they received the merchandise back. Today is Friday, and guess what? I have heard NOTHING from them.<br /><br />If it were possible to rate this no stars, I would. For them to knowingly sell expired food products and not stand by them is atrocious, especially in today's economy. They will never have my business again.
