I bought Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 32 oz., 4 pack, and first of all, it took nearly two weeks for it to be shipped and arrive despite the deceptive listing stating it was "In Stock" at all times.  More importantly, the product was completely rancid.  All four bags smelled like rotten fish with a mixture of paint odor.  This signifies horrible quality control and inferior processing for sorting the seeds prior to grounding and/or the grind processing itself as any flax seed processor will tell you. Evidently, "Bob" is really just a corporation who wants to make money rather than sell anything close to resembling an ordinary quality product which is sold by the rest of the industry.  If the bad seeds are not sorted out, this exponentially accelerates rancidity.  Also, the grinding process itself, if not done correctly and everything properly cleaned betweened grinding (imagine multi-year old rancid seed remnants sitting on the bottom and ground into the equipment that your so-called fresh and "organic" seed is mixed with and ground into) then you also accelerate rancidity.  As everyone knows flax seed meal has little to no omega-3 benefit at all as it is what is left over from the pressing to extract the oils for other uses ("Bob" thus making his money twice on the same seed), so the meal is basically just good for fiber like a million other (and much fresher) sources in nature.  However, to then treat this oil-defunct and nutrionally defunct product so poorly in processing and have such crummy quality control such that it is rancid by the time it reaches the consumer renders it useless and in effect a health detriment. Rancid remnant of oils will cause diarrhea at a minimum and far more free radicals than one is presumably tring to avoid to begin with. It also tastes like crap.  Worthless product in my opinion. I threw it all out and will never buy again. This should never happen.  I've been eating flax seeds, using the oil, and the meal for nearly a decade and know exactly what it is all supposed to smell and taste like.  I've tried many brands and ground it myself as well. Buy this product if you want inedible food leftovers with all the oils you originally were seeking taken out and are left with rancid remnants laced in fiber dust that will do anything but provide for health.
