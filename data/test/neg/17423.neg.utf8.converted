These are TERRIBLE! I gave it 1 star because you aren't allowed to rate 0 stars. On the scale of 1-5 stars, this product rates way below 0! I think plain birdseed would taste better. These not only taste like tree bark, but they are very hard...kind of like trying to chew on concrete. They are called crackers because they will crack your teeth! There are much better tasting GF options that truly are crackers, like from Blue Diamond and Glutino. Mary's Gone Crackers really are "gone" from my home...because I threw them in the trash!
