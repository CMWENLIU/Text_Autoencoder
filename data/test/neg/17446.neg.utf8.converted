I received the boxes wrapped in plastic to hold them in the tower and no ribbon the only thing that looks like the picture are the boxes but the arrangements I received are the perfect example of how something nice can look really ugly with no taste,  I bought 3 completely disappointed and I cant return them and Most likely I will keep just the boxes because I can't give this things as gifts to my friends,  UGLY UGLY UGLY.
