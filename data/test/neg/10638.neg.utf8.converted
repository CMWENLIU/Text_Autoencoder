Growing up in Europe as a kid leaves a huge mark on your sweet tooth, being spoiled by the flavor and quality anything sweet left in your mouth. Nutella is one of those sweet memories that unfortunately did not carry over to North America.  Made in, out of all the places in Industrial area of New Jersey, is not a good starting point for launching one of Europeans favorite chocolate wonders! Some ingredients do not stick with original standards, adding processed ingredients, still using sugar, which is better than corn fructose. topping it off by putting the product in plastic jars! At this point I suggest a sugar cube, topping it off with Hershey's syrup, if this is what you like, then you will love New Jersey made Nutella, it will be like Christmas. If you want to try real Nutella, buy the European version in a real glass jar, with real ingredients, real milk. German, and Polish is the real deal.
