The texture on this jerky is similar to other bad jerky, like Oberto. It's very dry, not hard but firm, and kind of falls apart in your mouth - but not in a good way. The flavor is dominated by smoke, whereas most jerkys also include soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.<br /><br />All in all, I'd eat this instead of stuff at the gas station like Oberto or a Slim Jim, but when push comes to shove I'll order Wild Bill's jerky, Big John's, or pick up some jerky at the local meat market.
