I purchased these chews at the request of my mom, who had read about them.We were both sorely disappointed, in that they start out OK, but as you near the end of eating one, you are left with a waxy film on your mouth, tongue and lips, which needs to be scrubbed off with a toothbrush!  It is disgusting!  And I wrote repeatedly to the company, asking for a refund, and telling them of the problem, and have never heard back.<br />A terrible way to do business, but a good idea.  The other company's calcium chews do NOT have this problem!
