I bought these because I was looking for an alternative to Gerber puffs for several reasons, including the sugar content and their corporate parent. These had good reviews so I decided to give them a try.  Good:  organic, not made by large corporate company, low sugar and all natural. My complaints are the following: 1) they taste stale right out of the package.  My baby probably doesn't know the difference, but to me the texture is soggy and chewy. 2) They don't taste like anything. Yes, I know I wanted less sugar but I assumed they'd taste like something! I bought the apple variety, so perhaps another flavor would be more interesting but these seriously taste like nothing.  3) the top doesn't stay closed very well.  AS I mentioned earlier, they come out tasting stale from the get-go, but the fact that the top doesn't stay shut very well makes them ridiculously stale within days. Unfortunately I cannot recommend these.
