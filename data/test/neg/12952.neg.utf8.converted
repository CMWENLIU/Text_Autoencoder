I used to like these chips when they had 2 grams of fat, but at some point in the past year or two they have changed to 3 grams of fat. This Amazon listing still claims 2, but if you check them out at whole foods, all the Guiltless chips have at least 3 grams. Some people may say that this increase is not significant, but you can a cheap bag of fried corn chips with only 4 grams of fat (can't think of the brand, but they come in a large paper bag), so 1 gram either makes a difference to you or is doesn't and you don't need baked chips.<br />If you want low fat chips, you can get baked blue corn chips at Trader Joe's with 2 grams of fat or at Henry's Farmers Market with only 1 gram of fat. Lay's also used to make corn chips with 1 gram of fat and absolutely no oil added, but they stopped selling those a couple of years back (and Lay's current lowest fat corn chips is 3 grams).<br />These Guiltless chips do taste good, but I certainly don't taste any difference from the new version than the old ones with 2/3rds that fat content.
