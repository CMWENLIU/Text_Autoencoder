I was extremely dismayed when I received the product only to read on the label that it contains WHEAT starch as well as honey. I was looking forward to using the powered form for baking and being allergic to wheat and other gluten products I can't use this. Also it cannot be returned due to some kind of laws about food products. PLEASE, Amazon and all sellers LIST allergens on the description of your product for the thousands of us who have food allergies.
