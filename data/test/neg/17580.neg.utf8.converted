If you are a Wisconsinite living outside of the cheese state and have a hankering for some classic brick cheese, this is not what you are looking for.  The product I received was a brick of white cheddar or some relative of a cheddar. It definitely did not have the lovely aroma of a classic brick cheese.  I was so looking forward to sharing this cheese with friends, but alas I was disappointed -- I guess I will have to go back to the Wisconsin to get my fix.
