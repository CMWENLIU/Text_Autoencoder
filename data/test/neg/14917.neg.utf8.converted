I was very excited that 7 years later, they decide to bring "Delfa Rolls" or "Danish Ribbons" back.  Seeing these reminded me of my childhood, so I bought a case.  It took WAY too long to receive the package.  It came a day after the latest estimation date.  I busted into the box so fast.  Ripped the packaging and dug right in.  As soon at it hit my mouth I knew.  These are NOT the same as they once were.  They taste fine, but they are not the same.  I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of "Delfa Rolls" than these are.  I'm very very disappointed!
