Maltesers are fantastic, but I wouldn't buy any food from Amazon ever again.  I've read too many reviews about stale food, and wow, this was about as stale as they come!  I tried eating them anyway, but after I got them, found them for sale in a store.  Wow!  What a difference!  These were terribly stale from Amazon, and I would be VERY hesitant about buying ANY food from amazon ever again.
