I paid $55 for a 96 pack of Maggi and was initially excited when it first arrived. However, as I was cooking it I noticed that it had an odd odor to it, and when I tried eating it, I realized the noodles were very stale. I checked to see what the expiration date on the packs was, but there was none listed (conveniently). I opened some other packs, and found each one to be very stale... they must be months over expired--maybe even more than a year. This has been quite upsetting, and I would not recommend it at all.
