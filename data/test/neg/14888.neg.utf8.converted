I am not sure if it was age or something else, but these just suck. Yes, I did refrigerate them right after opening the bag. I am sure it didn't help that Amazon sent them via Fedup-with-Fedex so they wasted away in Fedex's rotten warehouse for about 2 weeks before finally making their way to my door.<br /><br />Tough, very tart, odd odor. They certainly weren't edible as-is. Trying to hydrate them to get rid of the tartness didn't do much good. Tried to use them to make a sauce - cooking made them tender but the odd taste and aroma persisted. I am sorry that I wasted my money on this product.
