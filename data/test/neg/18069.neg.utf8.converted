Just to add my protest to the others:<br /><br />I purchased 4 13oz jars from Amazon in October 2007 for $12.32 plus $7.23 in shipping.<br /><br />This same order in January 2008 (yes, I use a LOT of malted milk) was still $12.32 but shipping was $13.75<br /><br />In August 2008 (did I mention LOTS of malted milk?) the price had increased to $12.48 but shipping was only $3.90<br /><br />The current Amazon listing does not have the 4-pack, but does list the 6-pack for over $30 PLUS another $17+ for shipping.<br /><br />We all need to find another source or get Amazon to keep its merchants from gouging us on price.
