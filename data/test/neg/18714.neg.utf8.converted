I won't be buying the Roland brand again ... the mackerel is made in China and it shows.  WAY too much liquid compared to other brands. A 15-oz can doesn't even come close to providing enough meat.  I don't like the looks of the mackerel, either - doesn't look fresh even though it probably is safe.  Spend a little more and get a different brand - I learned my lesson.
