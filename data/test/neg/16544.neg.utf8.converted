Due to the large amount of five star ratings this product got I decided to buy a case, even though I'd never tried it before.  I figured that all those people couldn't be wrong, could they?  Well, I am not a food snob by any means, but let me just say that even my husband, who will eat practically ANY pasta, did not like this.  The noodles were very...squishy.  Almost gelatinous.  The sauce was poorly seasoned and harsh tasting.  It was almost like pairing bad canned sauce with Top Ramen noodles.  I was expecting this meal to be not of the highest quality, but still good in the way that fast food is good - cheap, yet yummy and addicting.  It was cheap all right, but unfortunately the yummy part got left out.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that it wasn't so bad that we couldn't eat it.  However, I definitely wouldn't make it again.  I think the only people who will like this are those who were raised on it.  If you've never tried this before, you probably won't like it.
