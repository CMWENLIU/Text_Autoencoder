I bought this tea because I enjoy iced tea and it seemed like a nice variety of flavors.  I received the package and tried the raspberry tea.  It was okay, but had a strange artificial taste.  I looked at the ingredients, only to discover the sweetener used in the tea is Stevia.  With all the mixed reviews on these new sweeteners and their possible side effects, I have made a conscious decision to avoid them.  I am extremely disappointed that no where in the description does it mention that is is sweetened with Stevia.  The product description for the Sweet Lemon tea in fact says "the perfect balance of fresh squeezed lemon, fresh brewed black tea and all natural sugar."  I don't consider Stevia "all natural" sugar.  This is only my opinion and personal preference, but I feel like I was misled by this packaging.  I will now be throwing away all but the unsweetened black tea.  Had I known what was in these, I could have saved my money.
