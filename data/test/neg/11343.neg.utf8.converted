One star was given because of the condition of the cans.  Even though there were several reviews about dented cans, I decided to order this mix because I love pumpkin pies and cannot locate canned pumpkin in any store. I wouldn't mind a few small dents but most were severely dented and/or smashed. I am afraid to use them so I am returning the entire case.  I, too, believe the cans were damaged before they were packed, not damaged in shipping.  Maybe the same returned cans are being re-shipped???
