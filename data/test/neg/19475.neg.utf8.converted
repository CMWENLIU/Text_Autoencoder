I should have listened to the reviews I read on other sites when they said it tasted like water with weak chocolate flavoring.<br />Don't let anyone fool you. It tasted like a spoonfull of chocolate suryp stirred in hot water. I and my family found it undrinkable after a few sips and poured it down the drain.<br /><br />Very dissapointed in the Milka Corporation (who makes wonderful chocolate bars) to allow such a crappy product to bear their brand name.
