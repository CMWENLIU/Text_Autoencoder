I purchased this product for a friend. Instead of receiving chocolate covered beans I received a bag that consisted of melted chocolate. The shipping and handling was very high and I thought that the chocolate would probably arrive a little soft but this is just ridiculous. The bag looks and feels like it's filled with chocolate syrup.
