This is a great food brand, and I also like their diapers, but this formula does NOT dissolve well, and my 2 month old baby does not like it!!  He is mostly breastfed, but I supplement with Similac Organic with good results (no fussiness).  I gave Earth's Best a try, and my 10 week old baby cried and cried, and was having obvious gas pain, until I switched back to Similac.  I would much prefer to use this brand, so I tried again a few weeks later, and I got the same reaction from my baby.  I would definitely us caution when choosing this formula, although I realize all babies are different.  I will continue to use Earth's Best's other products, but not this formula.
