This coconut water is so salty, and actually has 120 mg of sodium per bottle (5% of your Daily Value)! I like that it is organic, it comes in a great bottle size, and that it really has a lot of great nutrients. In my opinion, although the flavor behind the saltiness is great, this is really not drinkable due to the sodium content.I guess coconut water just has a lot of sodium, but I've never had one that actually tasted this salty. However, I have had great success using this in baked goods and mixed drinks (alcoholic and non) it really masks the saltiness and I get all the benefits of an organic coconut water! I received samples of this product to review; I was not compensated for my review in any way.
