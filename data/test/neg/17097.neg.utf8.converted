This was an absolute waste of money, the number 2 ingredient? Flour. You can make this at home (if you like bland curry). Basically this is turmeric, flour and very little else. And I bought the hot versions which wasn't hot at all. Try Chiefs curry powder instead! I hate to write bad reviews but after reading the positive ones here I bought it and felt robbed.
