This is the worst most God awful rot gut I've ever tasted.  I was trying to replace Royal brand dark choc pudding which they stopped making.  I order a case of this crap and it's horrible.  AND I discover it's a non returnable item.  Great.  Anyone want a case of free choc pudding that tastes like chalk?  Don't waste your money and don't order pudding on line if you are not sure you'll like it.  PLEASE ROYAL brand, make more dark choc pudding.
