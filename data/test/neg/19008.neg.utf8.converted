I've been using the original blue Bags on Board refills off for over 10 years and have never had a problem. I ordered these for a change of pace; they are more transparent than the originals, which wouldn't bother me except they are also not as sturdy. I was using a bag from the 3rd roll in the package, and a hole tore while I was picking up. Ick! I will order the traditional blue rolls in the future!
