I wish I had known previously that Fees are glycerine based bitters, and it my fault I did not research this more.  However with the cocktail craze and people buying bitters at break neck pace these days.  One should know that "traditional" bitters are alcohol based extractions and give a much different flavor profile than sugar extracted bitters "glycerine extraction".<br /><br />I will try returning my bitters, which are untouched, as I learned my mistake after ordering.<br /><br />I highly recommend Scrappy's bitters from Seattle.
