Pros:<br />  - 100% Xylitol sweetened<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - pieces are small<br />  - flavor doesn't last long<br />  - gum is "stiffer" than mainstream gums<br />  - more expensive<br /><br />Xylitol is the main thing this gum has going for it. Some studies indicate the Xylitol may have dental health benefits. Other gums with Xylitol, such as Trident, also contain other sweeteners such as aspartame. This is sweetened with only Xylitol and so has more Xylitol in it.<br /><br />However, the sweeteners don't last nearly as long as Trident and the gum is stiffer to chew. Also, the pieces are small so I usually end up chewing two pieces at once. When I chew Trident, I chew one piece or even half a piece. Also it is significantly more expensive per ounce than Trident.<br /><br />It has been a nice to try and it is not an unpleasant gum, but I will go back to Trident. For me, the additional Xyitol content doesn't justify the lower quality and higher cost.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, let me know with your vote.
