I've been cutting back on my salt intake and thought this product would be good, however, it contains soooo much black pepper (it's the first ingredient listed on the label).  I can not use much  to season my food because the black pepper is overwhelming and then the food is too spicy and bothers my stomach. I can not recommend this product.
