The spices smelled heavenly when they arrived.  However, the product was poorly packaged, and the seal was broken with the spices leaking out into the box.  And, no, I wasn't going to try a food that was that poorly packaged.  Personally, I think sanitarily made and packaged food products are just as important as products that taste good.
