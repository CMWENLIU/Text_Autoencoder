I have eaten other Pamela products and have been really impressed with the quality. I was really disappointed with the luscious chocolate cake mix. It was decent at best when fresh and a few hours later when the cake had cooled down the texture changed and it became really dense and chewy, very unpalatable. I spit out the bite I had taken and threw the rest of the cake away.
