Don't let your Dogs get anywhere near gum with Zylitol in it. Don't leave it where a dog will accidentally get into it!!  They have no cure for dogs who eat it and it will, I repeat will kill them. There is nothing that will help.  They don't know yet why but if just a minute portion of a it, will kill your dog, what does it do to you?  I just don't chew gum anymore since it is so hard to find just old fashioned regular gum with sugar and no additives.  Aspartame;bad, Xylitol;worse. They all change motablism.  No wonder obesity is so prevalent now. I would like just regular sugar based gum.
