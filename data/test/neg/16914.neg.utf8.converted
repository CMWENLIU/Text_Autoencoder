My daughter drinks 2-3 of these each day.  I was buying this from Amazon prime until they racheted up the price.  I used to pay $14 which was competitive with Costco.  Now- it's just a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! I will buy it anywhere but Amazon now.  Unreal that they are now charging $6 more for the same milk!! Go elsewhere- even Whole Foods has it cheaper!
