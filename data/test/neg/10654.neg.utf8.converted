We purchased these bags for several months through Amazon and thought were they were a great idea for collecting dog poop.  The original we bags we purchased had a dull finish and the seams in the sides of the bags were quite strong.  The last batch of bags we received was made of a different material, one that has a shinier finish.  The seams in these bags are very weak and, more often than not, split open when you try and pick up the mess left by your pet.  This, unfortunately, can leave you with a handful of poop.  At the very least, you have the predicament of holding a potential mess in one hand and a leash in the other while trying get out a second bag.  We originally had Amazon sending us bags on a monthly basis.  That order has been canceled and we are looking for a new biodegradable bag.
