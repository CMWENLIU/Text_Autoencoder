Wick Fowler's Chili used to be my hands down favorite, but the last three times (third time was the fortunate last time) it was clear the recipe or ingredient quality had changed.  The recipe now seems to have to come off much darker and grainer and the flavor is thick and unpleasant.  I will not be purchasing Wick Fowler's Chili ever again - I'm sure I can do better with a made from scratch effort which will not take any significant increase in time, but a more sampling.
