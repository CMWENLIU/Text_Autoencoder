I ordered this and some Kona coffee at the same time. I was very disappointed in the Kona. Today I opened this and tried it, I was again very disappointed. This coffee has absolutely no flavor. I would give it zero stars if I could. I have heard from so many people about how good Jamaican coffee is I can only hope this was a bad batch or what they swept off the floor after grinding. I think I am finished buying coffee products from Amazon.
