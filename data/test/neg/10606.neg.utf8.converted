I would give this food -100 stars if possible.  Bought this about a month back.  Slowly transitioned my 7 yr old lab to the food.  First time I gave her more than 1/2 cup she had horrendous diarhhea.  Not just once, were talking many times throughout the night.  Stopped the food.  Got her back on her last food (Iams...allegedly inferior yet never gave her 12 hour diarhhea).  Tried the Blue one more time with the same result.  Google "blue dog food diarhhea" and you'll see that this is not an isolated incident.  I don't know what the story is, but I have never seen my dog so sick from a dog food.  Not worth it.  No thanks. Proceed with extreme caution.  Don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />Oh and I live in an apartment.  An apartment I just moved into a month ago.  An apartment that is very nice and had brand new carpeting that Ill need to steam clean to get spots out?  Yeah, not too thrilled with Blue.  I'm blue allright.  Blue in the face from the mess I cleaned up tonight.
