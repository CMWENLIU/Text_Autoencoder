This is really nasty. I've tried other green drinks, and I'm convinced this by far is the worse represented. It says Berry, but NOT A CHANCE! It's more like wheat grass with dandelion. I honestly dont know the effects it will have, because I just cant stomach the taste. Not even holding my nose and swallowing. I dread it. Will NOT buy or recommend others.
