So...given the history of this sweetener (discovered in 1848, naturally occurring, etc.) I was pretty excited to try it. I whipped out a recipe for snickerdoodles and went to work.. My first bite got a big thumbs up...then the weird "cooling" started up...like eating breath mint cookies.  My daughter called them "prank cookies."  Blegh.  Maybe I'll do some research on what can actually be made with this stuff, maybe not...it's sitting unused in my cabinet.
