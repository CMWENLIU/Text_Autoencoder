I purchased this to electrify a section of fence that was separated from the rest of my fence plan. I took the first one, installed it on the post, inside a box. I hooked up the fence and the battery and.....nothing.  I unhooked the controller and used the tester and it only gave an extremely weak reading.  No big deal, every manufacturer is capable of putting out a dud.<br /><br />Being smarter this time around, I plugged the replacement into the wall and checked it with the tester before installation.  Guess what--very weak reading again. What are the chances of two of them being bad?  I figured maybe my tester was bad, so I bit the bullet and touched both prongs. My tester wasn't bad.  Either I got two duds, or they're just not strong enough to get the job done.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm not trying a third unit.
