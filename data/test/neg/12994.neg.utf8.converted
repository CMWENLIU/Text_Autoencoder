For something called "Endurance" the lid broke off the first time I hand washed it.  Very cheaply made in the hinge area with no way to repair the hinge pin.  I'm mystified as to how it was attached in the first place.  It's almost like it was glued.  I couldn't find any solder or a weld joint.<br /><br />To echo the some of the other reviews this is most definitely NOT the one used by Alton Brown. The lack of the vertical handle is a shortcoming when you try to open it one handed off of the counter.
