Multiple discrepancies between the product package and the company website make it impossible for me to know what the correct crude protein level and sodium content of this product are. Customer service was less than willing and able to  help. I made all my attempts to find this info before offering it to my cat, who is supremely uninterested in this stuff. See my comment to Jim's review for details of my poor cust svc experience.
