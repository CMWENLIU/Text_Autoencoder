I live in an area with a very large Arab and Jewish population.  When I wanted Halvah, I just bought it anywhere and enjoyed it.  My experiences completely unprepared me for this product.  This product is completely tasteless and has a texture of bad, dry sand.  I wonder if it supposed to be some sort of low fat, diabetic version.  Well it isn't promoted as such and I recommend completely avoiding it.
