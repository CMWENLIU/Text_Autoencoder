I was very disappointed with this pancake/waffle mix.  Could not taste the vanilla flavor (very weak, if any at all) and compared to the Golden Malted brand, this mix has a tendendcy to stick to the belgian waffle maker, even with a fresh coat of vegetable oil.  Sorry, I won't buy this one again.  Note: with this mix, you only add water.  With the Golden Malted mix you add egg, water & butter, which may be what helps it not to stick to the waffle maker.  If you do purchase this brand, be careful because it cooks much faster, too.
