This is a fine product if you only plan to use the milk for cooking (as a dried powder). But OY! its not such a great drinking milk. I had a REALLY tough time mixing it (yes, I used warmish water like the directions suggested) - it turned out really lumpy and the liquid was almost oily in texture (even though I don't think there is oil in the product). I was disappointed in it for a drinking powdered alternative to cow's milk. I like the dried soy milk powder I get from my co-op better.
