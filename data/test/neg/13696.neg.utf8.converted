Although I'm not a former disgruntled employee, I have developed some reservations about "San Marzano" brand tomatoes.  When I bought my first can of these tomoatoes at my local grocery store, I thought, great San Marzano plum tomatoes stright from Italy for under $3 for a 28oz can!  Then when I got the can home and opened it, the tomatoes inside didn't look like the ones on the can.  They were round, and didn't look like plum tomatoes, which resemble little eggplants.  Further, after reading the label, I realized these tomatoes are from California, and have nothing to do with the San Marzano reigon of Italy at all.  What a dissapointment!  Buyer beware: these tomatoes are not from San Marzano, and probably aren't even plum tomatoes!  As for taste, it was OK, but definately I was left wondering 'where's the great, sweet, fresh flavor people say San Marzano tomatoes should have?'  If you are looking for an average tomato this brand should suffice, but if you want the real San Marzano tomatoes, please save youself the dissapointment and keep looking.
