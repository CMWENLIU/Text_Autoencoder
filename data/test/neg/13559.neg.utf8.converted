If you're looking to control digestible carbs -- not just sugar -- then it'd be nice to know that these bars have a ton of slow-release carbs, and may not suit you.<br /><br />Which is why, Amazon, it is REALLY frustrating when you don't include nutritional information for food. That's like trying to  buy a book without knowing the author, or a computer without knowing how much RAM, hard disk space, or video memory it has.<br /><br />Yes, sometimes that nutritional information is wrong. WE GET IT. So put on your warning, and move on. Pulling the information because some twits out there are, apparently, outfitting their Himalayan mountain expeditions based solely on the nutritional data you list, and then, I suppose, eating some of their porters when your calorie counts are off, isn't fair to the everyday Joes who just want something to munch on.<br /><br />For the rest of us, we'd just like to have some small inkling of what food is in the food we're about to buy. Pretty please. Because shopping from Amazon shouldn't mean I have to spend half my time Googling each product to find out what the heck it actually is.
