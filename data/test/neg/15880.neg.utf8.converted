This sounded like it would be soooo good so I bought 3 boxes. Man was I wrong. It tasted like artificially sweetened, watered down, fat free milk. I tried everything to salvage this purchase. I mixed it with real hot chocolate, coffee, tea; the only thing I accomplished was to spoil everything that I mixed it with. I finally, reluctantly, threw it all away.
