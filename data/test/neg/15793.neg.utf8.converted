I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it. The noodles are a little too firm for "ramen". The broth was ok...again, didn't hate it, but didn't like it. It didn't all dissolve (I followed the instructions completely) and it got kind of grainy at the bottom. I will eat the rest but will definitely not order it again.
