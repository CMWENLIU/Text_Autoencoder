I've seen these products at high-end pet stores.  Don't get ripped off.  This is a total waste of money if you live in a town with at least one Asian grocery store.<br />Go to your Asian grocery, preferably Japanese, and purchase dried bonito flakes, i.e. katsuobushi.  Katsuobushi is way cheaper and probably much better quality, as it's meant for human consumption.  There should only be one ingredient.  Bonito.  One of the ingredients we Japanese use to make dashi stock.
