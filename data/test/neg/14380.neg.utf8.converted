I tried these pretzelcrisps after thinking what a great idea.  Unfortunately there is so much salt on these things, it even made my lips burn when eating them.  Once I looked at the ingredients, not only was I shocked to see the amount of sodium in these (10 pieces have 23% of your RDA for sodium), but MSG is the third largest ingredient in this product.  WOW, what a shock.  These snacks left such a horrible after-taste in my mouth.  Unfortunately for taste these things get two thumbs down.  Stick with normal pretzels in this case.
