I really wanted to love this litter, but it just didn't impress me. I have 4 cats and 4 litter boxes that I scoop at least once a day so I am (sadly) a litter expert. I agree that there's significantly less dust and the little dust there is doesn't seem as irritating as the dust from the Tidy Cat scoopable litter I use. That's not a big deal for me though as I just pour the Tidy Cat slowly and turn my head away so the dust doesn't bother me. On the plus side, this litter weighs significantly less than traditional litter, which is nice when you have to lug it around. My cats were very willing to use it, but they are pretty easy going and have never "boycotted" the litter box for any reason as some cats do when you make a change. Now, for what I didn't like...<br /><br />I was really hoping for something that didn't get tracked all over the house, but I actually found that this was tracked further and quicker than my other litter. I'm sure of this because I only used this new litter in one box on the far side of the house so it was easy to see where and how fast it was scattered throughout the house. In terms of tracking litter, I actually found this to be more annoying than the Tidy Cat because these pellets are bigger. It was uncomfortable when I accidentally stepped on this litter in my bare feet (which happened often since it was tracked so far) and the bigger pieces show up more easily so it also looked really messy. To be fair, 2 of my 4 cats have long hair so litter gets trapped in the fur on their feet and I guess it was just worse with this stuff.<br /><br />This litter did provide good odor control, but I found it to be no better than my Tidy Cat scoop litter. Though the odor control was decent, the litter doesn't change color or otherwise indicate when it's been saturated by liquid waste and the "clumps" fell apart easily so I had to either scoop too much to be sure I got it all or risk leaving dirty litter in the box. That drove me crazy since this litter is pretty expensive if you have to throw away more than necessary just to be sure the box was clean. Because of this issue, I went through the bag more quickly than they estimate in the instructions.<br /><br />I suppose if the dust and the weight of traditional litter are big problems for you or if you really want to be able to flush your litter, this may be your solution. If you are looking for an alternative that is significantly better in terms of tracking, odor and cost, I don't recommend this at all. Also, the shipping costs were much too high (I searched everywhere online to be sure there wasn't a better deal) so be sure you factor that into the cost.
