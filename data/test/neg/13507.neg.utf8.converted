These bars are shipped via the U.S. Post Office. When I buy them in a store such as Whole Foods, they are fresh and the outer coatings intact. When I bought them through Amazon, the outer coatings were melted and in some cases stuck to the inside of the wrappers. It is not a case where they were left in a mailbox all day. My mailman handed them to me, along with the other mail. Don't buy this product from Amazon, pay a little more and get a good product.
