Yes, they stink - like rotting fish! You can rinse the smell away and add whatever you like, BUT the consistency of these noodles (I got the angel hair and prepared with my favorite homemade spaghetti sauce) is very rubbery. After smelling them initially, and then feeling as though I was chewing on tiny earthworms, I managed to down two forkfuls and threw the rest away. Color me crazy, but I'd rather have half a cup of real, delicious, high-carb pasta than a gallon of Miracle Noodles. What's that you said? Would I care for more Miracle Noodles? No, thanks, I'm having portion control.
