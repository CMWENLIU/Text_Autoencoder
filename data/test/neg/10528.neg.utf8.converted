The main reason I wanted to get this tea set was for the box and not necessarily for the tea.  I have been looking for a nice tea box for my wife to match our cherry cabinets.  Surprisingly, it is a lot harder finding a nice quality box with a window.<br /><br />Again to reiterate, I have not tried the tea so I will not comment on that.  The box however is very poorly built.  The picture is a lot nicer than what we received.  There is no way I could give this to my wife as a gift.  The inside compartments were bent and it looks like someone from elementary school pasted the inside lining because the felt was crooked and did not even cover the entire inside of the box.  The stain outside was uneven, especially at the lip where you are suppose to open the box.<br /><br />I had originally bought this because I saw a 5 star rating for this product.  Even though ratings are subjective, this product is far from a 5 star rating.
