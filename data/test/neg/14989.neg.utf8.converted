I tried this water and it tasted just "normal" to me. Not silky or special or anything.<br /><br />I gave my cats two bowls of water, each with 16 oz of water, one the Essentia and one of just tap water. I saw them drink out of both bowls and water disappeared from both bowls at the same rate.<br /><br />I looked up the pH of my local tap water and it tests between 6.7 and 9.7 pH with an average of 8.6, not so different from this bottle of water but a heck of a lot cheaper.<br /><br />It really seems to me like somewhere around the early 1990s we were all duped into buying bottled water. Some water isn't safe to drink and so it's good that we can get bottled water at times, but it somehow became a status symbol and then a necessity. Now people are either realizing maybe it's dumb to buy bottled water when the bottled water industry isn't even as well regulated as tap water, or moving on to other beverages as "plain" water is starting to seem a little boring, so what do the people who sell water do to sell more product? They make it fancier, with caffeine or gathered in glacial melt and harvested from the deep sea, or, it seems, with a high pH.<br /><br />There are all kinds of health claims made about high pH water, but as far as I know there aren't any reputable, scientific studies that back up any of the claims. If there were, I'm sure Essentia would be shouting those claims from the rooftops to sell their product.<br /><br />If you really believe you need water with a pH of 9.5, maybe research what the tap water in your area already is, and if it's not high enough for you there are many options for water ionizers you can purchase in all price ranges.
