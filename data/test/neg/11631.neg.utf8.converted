Pill pockets worked twice with my cat.  On the third night my cat bit into a piece of an antibiotic and wouldn't touch them after that. I tried cutting the pill into smaller pieces. I tried smashing one of his regular treats into the pill pocket.  I tried the chicken flavor of pill pocket.  No go. I'm having much better luck with a "pill gun." It looks something like a hypodermic. I can get the pill to the back of his throat so he has to swallow it. I usually get it on the first try. If your cat licks his nose, that's a sign that he's swallowed the pill.  My vet taught me that.
