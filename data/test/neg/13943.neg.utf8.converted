TWELVE pods for this amount of money?!?!?  That's almost $2.00 for a cup of coffee.  Robbery.  Do not buy this item.  Pods range from 25 cents to 50 cents a cup, usually, depending on brands.  Even Puck, which is usually higher, for good reason, and whose coffee I enjoy the most, should not be this high.
