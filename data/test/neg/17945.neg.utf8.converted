These chews come in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses which means some chews will be easier to chew than some of the others.  I have a German Shepard/ Lab mix and she is now almost 4 and is a really strong chewer.  I really wanted this product to work because keeping my dogs teeth healthy and clean will help her living longer.  My dog choked on this so badly that she couldn't clear her own throat and luckily I was watching her to notice that she needed help.  I reached into her throat and pulled it out.  Stupidly, I thought this would be a one time deal so I gave her more of these and just a few chews later she ripped off another large chunk and choked on that again.Since it was so far down her throat I could only shove the piece down and it cleared her throat.  She laid in my lap for 30 minutes after that incident.  I threw the bag away and wrote a review and there were many other similar events like mine.<br /><br />Please be cautious and watch your dog if you think these work for you.  All it takes is one treat to choke on to create irreversible damages.  The manufacturer has very minimal consequences if your dog dies because of their C.E.T. chews.<br /><br />I have purchased the other types of these exact chews, but this company creates different listings for the same exact product because the other listings have poor reviews.  Also, if you look at most of the reviewers who give this product 5 stars only have 1-5 reviews...that makes me suspicious of those reviewers as it seems they are some how motivated to give this product a 5 star review.  Most of those 5 stars reviews are not even confirmed as actually purchasing this product.
