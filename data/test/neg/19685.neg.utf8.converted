There is no kind way to say this. This is terrible.  There are several reasons why:<br />1.  It is thin like water<br />2.  It stinks (I could barely taste it without gagging)<br />3.  It is vinegar based.  If you think you would enjoy dipping your nuggets in vinegar then you would like this.<br />In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce.  When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date.  It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid.  They wanted me to mail it back to them.  If I could do that I wouldn't have ordered BBQ sauce online.  Not everyone can get to the post office.  What a complete waste of money and time.
