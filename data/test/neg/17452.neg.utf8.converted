I have a one year old, four pound Pomeranian and she goes through these bully sticks at record speed. Other brands last on average four to five days. One particular stick didn't last much longer than an hour.<br /><br />Also, the smell is overwhelming. I am used to the "bully stink" however these were especially pungent. Simply removing the stick from the bag would transfer the smell to the skin.<br /><br />Although shipping was very fast, I will not be ordering this product again. I think it is worth paying a little bit more for a less smelly and longer lasting bully.
