While the smell is amazing, the taste is lacking compared to other Earl Gray Teas. This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go.
