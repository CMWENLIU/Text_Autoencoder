I eat the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal every day, and unbeknownst to me, my wife started giving me the "Lower Sugar" version. On the first day, I just thought my taste buds were off and ignored it, but after a few days I started to wonder what happened to the oatmeal that I used to so enjoy. To me, it now tasted like chemicals.<br /><br />I went to look at the box to see that it said, "Lower Sugar". Now I had found a clue, but I couldn't really blame my wife because I don't really need the oatmeal to be super sweet. I'm fine with less sugar, although that wasn't my issue. It tasted like chemicals.<br /><br />Upon ingredient inspection, I found that this "Lower Sugar" version contains the artificial sweetener "Sucralose" which I am really sensitive to. I know some people can't really taste the difference between Sucralose and sugar. I wish I was one of them.<br /><br />I also wish that Quaker would have mentioned the artificial sweetener clearly on the front of the box.<br /><br />Be warned. It's not just lower in sugar, which I would have been fine with. We had to throw away 2 boxes.
