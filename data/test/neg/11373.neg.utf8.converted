It smelled right. It looked right. It tasted awful. I brewed a batch side-by-side with an Adagio Gyokuro, and there was no comparison. The SerendipiTea product was missing all the complex flavors and had a bitter taste. There was nothing smooth or relaxing about it.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the brittle cellophane packaging was torn, and there was loose tea everywhere in both the tea box as well as the shipping box.  By comparison, the Adagio Gyokuro packaging is a heavy sealed plastic bag with an internal zip lock.<br /><br />If this was ever a Gyokuro, it died somewhere in transit.
