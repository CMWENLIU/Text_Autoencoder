If you are truly desperate for pizza and need a gluten-free product, try this one box at a time. I threw the first box away because I thought my bread machine had malfunctioned. Then a friend tried my second box, and he realized the yeast was out of date. The consistency is odd. I use a lot of gluten-free products that are great. I am glad I did not start with this one, or I would have thought that a GF diet would be impossible. Overall my experience with it has been awful.
