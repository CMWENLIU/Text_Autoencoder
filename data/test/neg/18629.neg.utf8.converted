Unfortunately, this soda just doesn't taste good in orange flavor. It has a strange flavor, I think it might be the taste of the stevia interfering with the orangeyness. It's mildly unpleasant, definitely not something I would want to pay extra for.<br /><br />The black cherry flavor of Zevia is much better, really very nice.
