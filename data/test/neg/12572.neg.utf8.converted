This is a joke!!  I have never been so mad as I am right now writing this.  Not only is the coffee a big joke the way they shipped it is as well.  The assortment in this is ridiculous.  The majority of the coffee is french vanilla.  And hopefully we will like spicy eggnog and kahlua because those make up pretty much the rest of the coffee.  This looks like somebody threw in the coffee they didn't like into a box and sent it to the sucker who was stupid enough to buy it.  I am not usually this brutall with reviews but this angers me.  The coffee was in a brown paper bag and thrown in a box to ship.  If I could return this I would but this is not a purchase that can be returned. How sad this is.
