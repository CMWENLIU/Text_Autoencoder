We have a very strict diet (no:gluten/wheat, dairy/casein, egg, soy, chocolate among many others). This is by far the best "Allergy free" chewy granola bar out there, especially for the cost (you can get them at target for less than 3 dollars! They don't have a ton of flavor, but most of the things we eat don't so we're ok with that. I'd try a box of them before buying bulk, but as allergy sufferers this is quite a treat for us! :)<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />So, we have ordered these in bulk several times from amazon. Everything has always been great till this last shipment. at nearly 4.00 a box, I expect amazing quality, but unfortunately the first box we opened they were all hard as rocks. we contacted annies to get some help. They were worthless, and the woman we spoke to was like a robot. Worst customer service I have had in a LONG time. Needless to say, they weren't willing to do practically anything, and we are no longer purchasing their products. VERY disappointed, and will definitely be telling others about the experience. Though we loved these, but at 4.00 a box for 7 bars, and poor customer service on top of it, we're done!
