I have purchased Bassett's licorice all-sorts before from Amazon, but perhaps not the same size bag; those previous orders were excellent. However, I recently ordered two of the 5 pound bags allegedly from Bassett's.  They arrived in two unlabeled plastic bags--no brand name, no "nutrition info," no list of ingredients--absolutely nothing.  Nor was there a packing slip. The packing materials for the product were two empty, slightly padded priority envelopes that were empty. One one on top of the candy packages, the other on the bottom. I opened one bag of candy and tried a few pieces. They aren't fresh and don't have the usual Bassett's quality.  Instead, they look like generic candy sold in bulk. I've no way of knowing if Bassett's is in any way connected with this candy. I can't be sure what is in them because there is no labeling whatsoever. If indeed these are Bassett's candies, the bags should have the logo on them; there should be ingredients lists; there should be a packing slip! Don't buy from Cherryfield Candy. It looks like they operate out of someone's basement.
