If Amazon is still selling these for $27.oo for one box containing 8 poptarts ----don't buy them. Don't buy them at any price. Rice cakes have more taste than these! I bought one box at the local store for $3.97. They are tasteless. Maybe a hint of chocolate but all I really noticed was the bland cardboard covering called a cookie? I prefer to get my empty calories from things that taste good.
