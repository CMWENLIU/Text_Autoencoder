This one is cloyingly sweet.  I like white chocolate, and have had powdered white hot chocolate I have enjoyed before, but this is not it.  I think another reviewer summed it up with "sweet white water".<br />Until another manufacturer makes a white chocolate k-cup (perhaps forthcoming from Cafe Escapes?), I'm using my Keurig for the hot water and sticking with powdered for my white hot chocolate fix.
