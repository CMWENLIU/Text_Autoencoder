Very unhappy with this purchase.  There was essentially no taste.  The crust was basically flour with a little salt added, the ingredients on the inside of the bread tasted mass-produced.  Combined with the extremely high shipping costs, this is a very poor product.  If they sent me another one for free I would put it in the trash, it is just not worth eating.
