Gevalia is known as a great coffee, but I was a little disappointed with this particular blend/flavor. With a name like "dark chocolate truffle" I would expect to taste chocolate, but I didn't. There is a smell of chocolate in the air when it is being made, but not enough actually in the coffee when drinking it. I guess I am a chocolate snob because I want something that says 'chocolate' to actally taste like chocolate, but this particulalr coffee just did not do it for me.
