Although the product grew very quickly (within one week) and our cats absolutely loved the product, we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth. I'm assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth. We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn't eat themselves silly, so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time. Regardless, I would never purchase this product again because I don't want to risk my cats getting sick from it. We are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we're trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants.
