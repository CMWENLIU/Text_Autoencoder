I ordered two boxes of the Treats For Troopers Snack Package on April 13 to arrive for my Soldier's 20th birthday on May 13. As of May 15 it hasn't arrived and I'm a little disappointed that his birthday has come and gone without his little "party in a box". As soon as I receive word that it has arrived I can post a better review. It's what he told me they most enjoy receiving while deployed in Iraq for themselves. Boxes of little toy animals is what they enjoy getting to give away to the kids.<br /><br />Well it's almost Christmas and the boxes never did arrive to my soldier. I'm out the money and even though the supplier assured me that they had sent it it never arrived. I asked my son if others were having difficulty in getting their mail and he said they were not. All I can assume is that after two attempts, this item was never actually shipped at all and my money is gone! Great birthday present for my 21 year old Soldier, huh?<br /><br />He is now safe at home, stationed in Colorado. That was a great gift for me. I'll be seeing him for Christmas. I won't be using this company to send him any more goodies.
