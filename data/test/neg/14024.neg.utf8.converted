I've been through many boxes of Ancient Harvest Quinoa, since I love quinoa and for a long time this was the only brand I could find. It suffers from two main problems.<br /><br />First, quinoa naturally grows with a layer of saponins, which are bitter and indigestible. Most brands of quinoa, including Ancient Harvest, are pre-washed to remove the saponins. However, Ancient Harvest doesn't do a very good job. Unless you rinse the grains even more, they'll still taste bitter. (If you cook it in a lot of water, as you would pasta, it's okay. But cooking it like rice requires more washing.)<br /><br />Second, and much worse, Ancient Harvest does a terrible job of sorting their grains. Every bag has little pieces of stem or other detritus. Even if you spend a bunch of time picking through the grains (and who wants to do that?), expect a couple of unpleasantly crunchy mouthfuls as you bite into a twig. This makes it unsuitable to serve to company, unless you like embarrassment.<br /><br />There are better brands out there that don't have these problems. I'd recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG3UE">Bob's Red Mill</a>, which so far has had consistently good quality.
