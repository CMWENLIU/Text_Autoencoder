This product deserves more than 1 star, but I am pissed off that the bag contains mostly pineapple and only a couple tiny pieces of mango. Rip off! I also don't like how SUGARY everything is. I wish the pieces were smaller too, you can't exactly put these huge chunks in yogurt or anything good. The mango is incredibly good, too bad there was literally no mango pieces inside.
