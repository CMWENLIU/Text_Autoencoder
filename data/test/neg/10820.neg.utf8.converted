I bought the Whiskas Choice Cuts Seafood Variety Pack for my cats because they were starting to eat wet food (I had had some success with some canned foods), and it looked like good-quality, succulent food that I hoped my cats would enjoy. However, my cats had other ideas. They liked licking the juice (one nice thing about this product: the food is nice and juicy), but they left the meat to sit, ignored. I tried a couple different flavors, same result. I also found it difficult to get the food out of the pouches; cans are much easier to work with.<br /><br />So, the unused pouches went back to the store for a full refund, which was nice. But too bad; I had hoped this would be a good food for my kitties. But I can't force-feed 'em, so...
