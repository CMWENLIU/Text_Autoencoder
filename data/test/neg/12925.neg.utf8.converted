I was very excited to see this product on amazon, and it was prime eligible! Many of my family members have a severe gluten allergy and I was excited that this Christmas we could sit down and celebrate with cookies/cakes/pies/etc. However, when the boxes arrived I saw on the bottom, in bold, "may contain traces of soy." This was not mentioned anywhere on the product description or nutrition facts. Many of my family members also have a sever soy allergy, and this "may" prevented us from being able to use the mix and therefore I have 6 unopened boxes that Amazon will not let me return.<br /><br />If the Gluten-Free Pantry bills itself as caring about food allergies, perhaps they should make sure they list every single ingredient on their product page so we can make a clear, educated choice when buying.
