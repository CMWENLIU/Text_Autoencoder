This flavored chocolate confection is merely okay.<br /><br />First off, it isn't really chocolate over pomegranate seeds.  That would have been cool.  Instead it is chocolate that supposedly has the flavoring from a different confection from the same manufacturer, and that confection supposedly tastes something like pomegranate.  That stuff is mixed into dark chocolate to make this stuff.<br /><br />The dark chocolate part of this confection isn't semi-sweet, which is what I'm used to seeing for dark chocolate, instead its regular sweet, making it too sweet.<br /><br />Some of the confection appears to have that beige dimpling that occurs when chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, is exposed to the elements.  I don't know if its water, or air that does that, but this package was like that.<br /><br />Many of the small balls were stuck together into large constellations.<br /><br />All in all this confection isn't disgusting, but it hardly deserves the rank it has.  I'd say all in all its pretty 3-star average.<br /><br />EXCEPT, this treat has a fatal flaw: it doesn't taste like pomegranate.  Not even a little bit.  Nope, no trace of pomegranate flavor is perceptible.  It tastes like not-pomegranate.  And that not-pomegranate taste isn't readily identifiable.  I eat fresh pomegranates regularly, and so have an inkling of their flavor, and that pomegranate-flavor isn't contained within this chocolate confection.
