Buyers beware of this rip off--the Earth's Best infant formula (and Vermont Organic) is produced by exactly the same manufacturer and are the same to the microgram.  Literally THE EXACT SAME STUFF just re-packaged and marked up 40-60%, depending upon where you are buying it.  Go with the Wal Mart Organic brand if you want this formula, because you're throwing your money away otherwise.  I was glad I'd only bought one can of the Earth's Best before I realized this!
