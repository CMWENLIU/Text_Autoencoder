If you are used to an organic water processed french roast decaf, don't try this coffee!!  I tried the Eight OClock Decaf beans based on good reviews here (and elsewhere admittedly) and was completely disappointed.  I felt that it lacked taste, body, aroma and that it had what I can only describe as a slightly bitter, metallic taste.  I drink my coffee black with no milk or sugar.  I guess coffee really is an individual thing!
