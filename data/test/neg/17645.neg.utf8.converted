It's my fault. I should've read the nutrition facts and saw how much sugar is in this jerky. It was an expensive mistake. I now have $40 worth of beef jerky that tastes like candy. At first I thought they sent me teriyaki by mistake, but no, it's the original recipe. To me, if the organic beef is so great, you don't need to cover it up with a bunch of sweetness. I want to taste the meat, not the evaporated cane juice. I hate to give this product a bad review as it's just my personal taste. It's not a bad product--it's completely organic with no nitrites. It's tender. It just tastes like a meat lollipop.
