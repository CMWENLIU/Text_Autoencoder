I felt like I was drinking pure sugar.<br /><br />Which, it would seem, is exactly what I am drinking.<br /><br />It says its all natural juice with no added sugar, but the ingredient label says:<br /><br />"Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon Juice Concentrates"<br /><br />I think they're using the old %100 juice trick where, instead of just using sugar or high fructose corn syrup, they distill all the sugars from fruit juice, so even though its no different in nutrition than cane sugar, its still technically "%100 fruit juice" giving people the impression that its healthy and that they should be okay paying way more for whats essentially sugar water.  Its mostly done for product consistency, so every package of juice tastes the same, but its still somewhat deceiving to let people think they're buying juice when all they're getting is the sugar that was originally in the juice.<br /><br />This trick is commonly done with apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the first two listed as being reconstituted.  I can't say for sure that this is what this company is doing, but I wouldn't be surprised, its more common than you'd think.<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm drinking soda with regular sugar in it.  35 grams of sugar in an 8 ounce can?  If anything, that sounds WORSE than regular soda.  Oh, and its a dollar a can?  And the cans are only 2/3rds the size of a normal soda can?<br /><br />To me that doesn't sound like a good alternative to soda.<br /><br />The flavor isn't bad, but its waaaaay too sweet, like I'm drinking candy.  While using a better kind of sugar than high fructose corn syrup DOES make it a better quality soda, I'd still rather buy a cane sugar soda like Jones instead.  It tastes great AND it doesn't masquerade as a health drink either.
