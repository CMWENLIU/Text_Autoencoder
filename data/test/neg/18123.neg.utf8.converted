My most recent purchase through Amazon was not good.  It was Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)<br />The tuna has an odd somewhat metallic taste and smell.  I tried three of the cans and am concerned that they may have changed their source or methods.<br />I contacted the company but received no response.
