Usually when I buy foodstuffs from Amazon, the expiration dates are very reasonable. But, this coffee has a three month expiration. The bags were rather beat up from the warehouse, the vacuum seals have failed and the coffee tastes stale. Next time I'll pay extra and get it fresh directly from Community. Normally, this is pretty good coffee but not this time.
