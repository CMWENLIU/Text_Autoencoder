I had used THIS product for over 2 years. During that time I gained 20 pounds although I was eating a healthy diet (besides adding this agave nectar). I gained the weight mostly in my stomach. My doctor and I were at a loss as to what was causing the weight gain. My cholesterol and triglycerides went up as well as my liver enzymes. A friend told me that this product was made essentially the same way HFCS is made. I didn't want to believe him! I investigated several sources and found that I had been duped about this product. I threw an unopened case (6 bottles) in the garbage. Since then, March 3, 2010, I have lost 10 of the pounds gained (thankfully from my stomach) and and am having fewer problems with swelling and bloating of my hands and feet. I won't know about the cholesterol or the liver enzymes until my next physical. This is a High Fructose "created" sweetener, up to 90% fructose compared to 50-55% found in HFCS. I for one won't let HFCS or HFAN into my house.
