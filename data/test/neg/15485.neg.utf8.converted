Ghirardelli should be a fine chocolate product, but this cocoa when used according to directions is so sweet it's sickening.  I tried using less, then there was no chocolate flavor.  This should be a better quality product in keeping with the name -- cut down the sugar, and more chocolate folks!<br /><br />No complaints with Amazon -- package arrived in good shape.
