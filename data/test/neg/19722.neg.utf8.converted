I have stocked our dogs' treat pantry with Plato's Farmers Market products for about a year. My dogs love their Salmon and Salmon with Vegetable treats. I recently purchased their Sweet Potato treats, which have a "Best by" date of 9-22-10. Shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white & blue mold. Unacceptable & disgusting. The bag's sticker has "X00133D6P" on it. I have bought Plato products many times previously and have been pleased, however, these are supposed to be safe and quality treats. I absolve the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet, of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue. However, I do firmly assert that Plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of Sweet Potato treats.
