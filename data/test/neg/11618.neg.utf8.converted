Now that I'm stuck with 4 bags of this stuff, I'm trying to muscle through it (can't bring myself to throw it away)... but I really miss my old granola.  This product is too sweet, and has another taste (vanilla?) that I can't quite place but I find distracting from what should just be a good granola taste.  On a positive side, it's of good consistency and arrived tasting very fresh.  But usually I just can't eat enough granola, and with this product I feel like I'm taking medicine - it's not tasty.<br /><br />I'm mixing this in with cereal... perhaps this granola would be better suited for baking.  Sorry, I can't give this oatmeal my full endorsement.
