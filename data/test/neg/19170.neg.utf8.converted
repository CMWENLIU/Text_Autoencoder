I buy quality, more natural mac & cheese quite regularly and was a long time customer of Annie's products. Unfortunately I often found that glue and other contaminants (which spark when heated) made it into the finished products Annie's sells. I contacted the company about this and was ignored twice before receiving a very brief a reply that there was no danger to the consumer. Call me skeptical but eating glue (it's probably from the sealant used on the box tops) caked to the pasta does not seem to me like a good idea, and I wasn't exactly thrilled with Annie's customer service, which was mostly dismissive (ignored my first two missives to them). There are plenty of great products and companies out there. I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese now, and actually prefer their spirals with white cheddar to Annie's shells and white cheddar.  These also cook much faster than Annie's shells, which always seem to take extra long to cook fully. No sense taking a chance on eating toxic substances when looking for a healthier alternative to the chemically heavy products from Kraft and the like.
