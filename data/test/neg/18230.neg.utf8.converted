I purchased this product to use in my breadmaker, and my machine produced a fine looking small loaf. The directions on the Cranberry Crunch Bread package were simple to follow. The basic question is "where is the crunch and where is the flavor"?<br />There were a few cranberries scattered throughout,no nuts visible to the naked eye and a taste that was comparable to standard white bread. Not a hint of sweetness to be found.<br />To be fair, the package did say that you could add some honey to the mix during preparation, and I did not, as it was optional. I thought it might make it too sweet. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Just not worth the price.
