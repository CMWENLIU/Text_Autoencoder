I recently purchased a case of Zevia.  I was anxious to try out this product.  It arrived today, much to my delight.  After drinking just a half of a can, I came down with a terrible headache.  I couldn't believe it.  The culprit...ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol, the second ingredient in the product; not STEVIA, the fifth ingredient. Also, the product is purported to have -0- calories.  Erythritol contains 2.6 calories per gram.  There are 12 grams of erythritol in each can.  Most erythritol is made from fermenting GMO corn.  How healthy is that? This beverage is VERY expensive and would be well worth it if it were truly an all natural<br />drink, sweetened only with stevia, which is what I thought I purchased.
