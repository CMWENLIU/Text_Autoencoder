I'm an old hand at growing my own sprouts. But for some reason I can not get onion sprouts to grow well. It's not just this brand ( although I had hoped this one would grow for me ) it's all brands of onion sprouts. I have even soaked the seeds over night. After several tries I have given up. Unless you have some magic formula, or extra green thumb - save your money and go for a different sprouting seed.
