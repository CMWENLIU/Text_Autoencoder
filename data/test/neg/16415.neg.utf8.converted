I truly love Bassett's JBs!!!!  If you buy them, and you love sweet jelly candy - you'll love these guys!  However, I bought the item thinking the package was the bag about 3 times this size - mistake.  This package is 215g which weighs 1/2 pound.  $20 for a pound of these is a complete rip!!!!  This item actually sells for about $3 in stores where you can find this English treat.  Be careful - unlike me.
