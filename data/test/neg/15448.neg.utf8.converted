Monosodium glutamate (MSG) can trigger headaches and other symptoms in some people.<br />Aw...then we get some garlic powder among other fillers after salt and MSG. There are much better, both convenient and healthy spices and herbs combinations (real food) to choose. Check out Frontier's line - inexpensive, many are organic and ingredients include the spice or herb itself or some tasty combination. There's a new line (to me) I have not tried, but prices are low and product is organic - Red Monkey.
