It is probably one of the most recognizable bottles if you are looking for absinthe.  After seeing the word "Absente", taking a look at the bottle with the attractive vintage-like label and the line "Absinthe refined" you are sure you have found a nice absinthe for not so much money.  Specially since most of the time the bottle comes in a box with an absinthe spoon as gift.  However, although nice, the presentation does not live up to the promise.  Specially after you take a look at the fake importation stamps.<br /><br />Problems with this drink:<br />- First, see the tag "Absinthe liqueur"?  A liqueur means a spirit that has been bottled with added sugar.  Real absinthe does not come with sugar.  You are free to add it later, but it should not come with it from the manufacturer.<br />- Second, it is made with Southern wormwood (Artemisia abrotanum).  To be considered real absinthe, it has to be made with grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).  Substitutions in the main ingredients are not valid when talking about absinthe.<br />- Third, it is artificially colored.  Real absinthe get its color from the chlorophyll of the plants of which is made, or no color at all; even though, the green is always subtle.  Being bright lime green is in no way a good thing.<br />These three points are enough for this drink to not be considered absinthe at all.  Some other things to consider are:<br />- It is overly sweet.  It's no wonder, considering it is bottled with sugar.<br />- You only can taste anise.  No other herbal flavors, or the subtle bitterness of wormwood.  Just anise.<br /><br />However, it has some good things:<br />- It is way cheaper than real absinthe.  If you are going to try it for the first time, it can be a good substitute; so if you decide later that you don't care for it, you are not out of a lot of money - this drink comes in mini bottles too.<br />- It does louche (meaning it changes color when you add water, turning milky).  That is always fun to watch.<br />- It provides a good example of what real absinthe tastes like.  Mainly of anise.<br /><br />Overall, this can be a fine pastis or absinthe substitute.  By all means, buy a bottle and share it with your friends at a party.  Just be advised that:<br />1- It is not absinthe.<br />2- You should not gift it to your absinthe-loving friend and expect a great reaction<br />3- You should not buy it if you have or plan to have an interest in real absinthe.  This spirit just does not cut it.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.
