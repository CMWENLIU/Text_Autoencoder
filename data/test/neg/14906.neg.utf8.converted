I bought this because it was labelled organic without really reading the label. My mistake. It is from concentrate and has "natural flavors" added. Why on earth would coconut water that is fresh need flavoring added? (and just because it is called natural flavors, does not mean it is natural - it is still made in a lab, it just means it must have originally been derived from something natural before it is processed).<br /><br />Skip this and go with something that is actually fresh coconut water.
