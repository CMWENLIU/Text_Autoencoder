I thought this product was great, even if maybe it did not seem as pure as more expensive brands.  Then I decided to reuse one of the glass jars after I emptied the salt into a salt shaker today.  After peeling off the label, I realized that the jar had scratches in the glass on the INSIDE of the jar, with the serious potential for having glass particles mixed in with the salt.  I went to the next jar.  It is still safety sealed and unopened.  I peeled off the paper label from the outside of the jar, and inside the sealed jar there is a hair!  It looks like it could be a rat hair, but I have not tested it obviously.  I do hope the FDA will test it--I am contacting them in the morning.  This second jar also has numerous scratches in the glass--approximately 20 scratches, many of them black (dirt in the scratched glass).  The company was not at all concerned--they just told me if I didn't purchase it directly from them, I should ask amazon for a refund.  I explained that the main point of my call was certainly not for a refund but to protect consumers from DANGER!  They called me back and said IF I returned their jars, they would replace the salt.  I refused the replacement and am hoping the FDA will examine the jars.  It is a little alarming that Amazon has no procedure for pulling the salt from its shelves and checking the remaining jars.  The customer service rep at Amazon said she was sorry but unfortunately Amazon waits for a second person to complain before pulling a product.
