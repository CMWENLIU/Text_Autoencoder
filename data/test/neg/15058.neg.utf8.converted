I've been drinking and evangelizing Good Earth for probably close to 20 years, and have turned a lot of people on to it. A lot of "natural" brands emerged over the last 20-30 years, and most felt like they were sort of greenwashing exercises. Good Earth was a product and company that I actually loved and trusted. The original herbal Good Earth tea is sort of irreplaceable as a sweet, caffeine free natural beverage. Two hours ago, I would have given it a 5-star rating based on the box that's in my cupboard.<br /><br />But I just got back from the store, where I discovered that in addition to changing the package (sad but no big deal), they've changed the recipe to include artificial flavorings. I'm absolutely flabbergasted that they have decided to throw away decades of customer trust this way. Artificial flavors in Good Earth tea! I want to die, just so I can roll over in my own grave.<br /><br />Is the tea still tasty? I expect so, though when you throw chemical flavorings into the mix, my beverage options just got about a thousand times broader, and I don't think I'll ever find out. Are artificial flavors really that bad? Again, maybe not, and when I'm lazy I'm sure I consume a lot of them. But that makes the loss of a really great natural product that much harder to take.<br /><br />If it were any other product or brand, I wouldn't give it a second thought. But as I said, Good Earth was special. Almost sacred, as I could do a little relaxation ritual during my day that centered around it. Now it feels like that tiny but precious sacred trust has been broken, and I feel curiously hurt by it.<br /><br />It's hard not to feel like they've turned their back on the natural ethos that the original core customer base embraces, and corrupted the name Good Earth irreparably. They certainly have for me.
