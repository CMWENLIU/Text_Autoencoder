Ya know, we tried this product and loved everything about it except the fact that they are made in China (and they are quite pricey) We've had toy recalls b/c of lead in paint on toys MADE IN CHINA, we've had dog food recalls b/c of melamine in the food MADE IN CHINA.  Even though these products have SOME American grown fruits and nuts in them, that promising fact is completely RUINED b/c it's all shipped to China where it is made into bars, etc. and packaged. If you know anything about how much pesticide and insecticide is used on those ships --and how many rats are on board--you'd probably refrain from eating this product again.  C'mon Mrs. Mays--if you really want to be "wholesome," you'll choose to make and package your product right here in the good ol' USA where oversight is better and, in which case, your fruits and nuts would not be exposed to the toxic environment of a slow boat to China.  Also, you wouldn't want to encourage the horrible work conditions in China for the Chinese people. Mrs. May's needs to JUST SAY NO TO CHINA, make an all-American product, and then we'll buy!  For now, even the half-price lightning deal just is not worth the risk of the product being "poisoned" or tampered with in China.  We recommend buying a bag of nuts and a few pounds of fruit--it'll be less expensive!! Who needs the bars after all, although they are convenient.<br />Read this from Mrs. May's website:<br /><br />IS THE PRODUCT ACTUALLY MADE IN THE US WITH US INGREDIENTS?<br />No, we ship our raw materials to China from USA and they are packaged in China and brought back to USA.<br />Direct Link if you want more information:<br />[...]
