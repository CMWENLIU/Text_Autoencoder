As other reviewers have pointed out, I am also disappointed in the reformulation of this product and in the fact that the company didn't properly disclose this information. I buy this in bulk for personal use and, as others, also thought for a minute that I got a shipment of expired or spoiled product. To clarify, both the taste and the consistency have changed from before. The product is now thicker and overall tastes closer to typical protein drinks which for my personal taste is a letdown. There are dozens of other protein drinks on the market and this one had a distinctive taste and consistency that are now both gone. I will look for a replacement, since this is part of my daily diet.
