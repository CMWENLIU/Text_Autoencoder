I was happy to find there are natural chewing gum out there and just bought 12-packs of these.  The ingredients say Titanium Dioxide is also used.  Titanium Dioxide is one of the top 50 chemicals produced worldwide!  Google it and you find that it is "a white, opaque and naturally-occurring mineral found in two main forms: rutile and anatase. Both forms contain pure titanium dioxide that is bound to impurities. Titanium dioxide is chemically processed to remove these impurities, leaving the pure, white pigment available for use."  Titanium Dioxide, especially in ultrafine form, could be carcinogen or disease causing, and we currently still have limited knowledge about its health effects, but does that means we should take the risk?  If Glee Gum added Titanium Dioxide to their gums just because it makes the gums LOOK white and 'pretty', it is a VERY BAD decision.  People choose to buy 'healthier' gum absolutely would not mind how the gums look as long as they are truly natural. I am very disappointed. I really hope Glee Gum removes this chemical from their gum and make truly natural gums.
