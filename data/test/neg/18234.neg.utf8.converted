ok people just to let you know real Kopi Luwak sells for around $300 per pound if not more. this is a blend of beans. what they dont tell you on this page is youll be lucky if theres 3% Kopi Luwak mixed in with who knows what other beans. ive seen a similar posting like this for $50 using the same picture but it tells you its only 2% Kopi Luwak. dont buy this if you want 100% Kopi Luwak
