These are low-quality crunchy cookies, similar to Chips Ahoy. I don't know how anyone could confuse these with "home-made" cookies. Brown packing doesn't mean it's healthy or any better for you or the environment. These are still factory-made sugar and fat bombs, "natural" ingredients or not. Buyer beware.
