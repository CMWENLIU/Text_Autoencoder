I love Truvia sub sugar which is made from the Stevia plant, so I thought Zevia, the drink made with Stevia, would be good. But on the contrary _ I opened one can and could barely finish it. It's grossly  and sickeningly sweet with a horrible after taste and next to "no carbonation" in the can. GOD AWFUL..whoever let this on the market should be fired..
