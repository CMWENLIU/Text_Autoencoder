I don't know what others got, but I was shipped a box of teeny tiny little pig ears in a box that said they were a product of Spain. All 100 (if that's how many are even in there) of them were inside a plastic bag about the size of a potato chip bag inside the box. You could have fit several of those bags in the box, but I got only one. It would take 4 of these pig ears to equal the size of just one that I can buy from my local pet food store for about $1.00 a piece. That is no exaggeration. To help you visualize this, the average size pig ear is smaller than my computer mouse (and I have a typical mouse. All I can say is don't make the mistake I made. After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a quality product. Well, while it appears that it was at one time, it certainly isn't anymore. I weighed the bag and it was a bit over 4 pounds. I paid $80 after shipping. That means I paid roughly $20 per pound for this junk! And since these don't come from the United States, there's no telling if they're even safe for my dogs to eat.  What a complete rip off!!!<br /><br />edit: Check the "customer images" of this product. I uploaded two photos that show the average sized pig ear.
