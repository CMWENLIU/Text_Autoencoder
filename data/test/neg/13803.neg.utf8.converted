This tea did not taste like I expected it to.  For a long time I have been using the loose leaf White tea with Jasmine from EnjoyingTeas.com and have been really happy with it.  But I wanted the portability that tea bags offer and EnjoyingTeas did not have any product to offer. So I purchased "REPUBLIC OF TEA Asian Jasmine White Tea" at Cost Plus World market for about $14.<br /><br />When I opened the canister, it did not smell like jasmine, but more of a rancid candy smell.  Jasmine usually has a sweet floral scent and taste, and marries well with green and white teas.  This tea did not smell or taste like that,  It almost smelled like it was mixed up with the Orange flavored white tea that they offer.  I used Sparkletts bottled water since I am not a fan of the tap water taste in tea, and even with the better water, there was no light tea taste like there usually is with white tea.  The tea did turn a golden yellow like it should have, and but had a tang taste that did not taste like jasmine.  With tap water one could only imagine that the taste would be much worse, at least where I live.  I have read elsewhere that the tea used in tea bags is usually lower grade, and usually tastes that way. I will resort to buying a box of tea filters/bags and make my own tea bags with the loose leaf tea that I already have.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are familair with the taste of white teas, these tea bags will only be a dissappointment.  Try the loose leaf White tea with jasmine instead.
