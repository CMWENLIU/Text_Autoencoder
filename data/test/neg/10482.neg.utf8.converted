I have two little girls, ages 5 and 7, and for Easter this year, I decided that I wanted to get them a cute little bunny rabbit as a pet.  Well unfortunately for me, all the pet stores nearby were sold out, due to the popularity of rabbits at that time of year.  I had nearly given up on finding one, when I ran across this listing for fresh whole rabbits on amazon.com.  I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured "hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did.
