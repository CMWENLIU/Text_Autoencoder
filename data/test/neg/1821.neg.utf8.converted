I had great hopes that this was the answer for my pasta cravings.  Wrong!!!  I bought a big box of 15 packs of noodles.  I did have great hopes with all the wonderful reviews I read.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more, but the smell was terrible.  I would gag from just the smell of them.  Needless to say they all went in the trash.  Even my dog wouldn't eat them and he will even eat dead stuff off the road (road kill) so you see he is not picky. Don't do like me, just order one pack until you see if you like it.  That was very expensive to throw away.  I tried several ways to make it work.  I thought I would never get the fishy smell out of my sink even after bleaching it, there was that fishy smell.  If you love the way fish smells this is for you but be aware of all of this before you order!
