I've had very good luck with some of the teas sold by Amazon (for example, Good Earth and Triple Leaf brands), but not with this product.  Contains four different types of teas specifically formulated to combat the sniffles.<br /><br />Breathe Deep:  Tastes like jasmine incense (though licorice root and eucalyptus leaf are the top ingredients) with an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />Cold Season:  Very powerful smell, taste, and aftertaste.  Ginger root and licorice root are the top two ingredients.<br /><br />Throat Comfort:  Licorice root and fennel seed the top ingredients.  Can really taste the fennel and soothing to the throat but gave me stomach upset and a headache.<br /><br />Echinacea Immune Support:  Peppermint leaf and lemongrass are the top two ingredients (note that peppermint is not recommended for those with GERD).  Echinacea root is the third ingredient. Can taste the top two ingredients.  It is not an unpleasant tea, but does have an odd aftertaste.<br /><br />There is a pattern here:  Licorice root is prominent in these teas' formulations.<br /><br />Buy at your risk:  They cannot be returned under Amazon's grocery policy, though Amazon did kindly refund my money after complaining.  Yoga does not have a customer satisfaction statement on the box, so don't know how the company would handle customer dissatisfaction.
