Pleased to finally locate a coconut extract at a reasonable price, BUT very disappointed in its flavor. We tried it three times; all three times we were completely dissatisfied with both the fragrance (Where was the expected wonderful aroma of coconuts!)and the taste (It tasted very artificial, not coconutty. Husband called it "plastic" tasting.)We poured the remaining extract down the drain, then tossed the bottle in the recycle bin. Thanks, but NO thanks!
