I bought these because it seemed a compelling way to get plant stanols, which medical literature praise for their cholesterol reducing abilities.  I don't consume a lot of bread, so the benecol/stanol butter substitute spreads were not a reliable source of stanols for me.<br /><br />However, these chews aren't all they are cracked up to be.  If you have 4 chews per day (like they suggest), you get 16 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 80 calories!  For anyone who has high cholesterol + high triglycerides, that isn't a desirable way to get your stanols.  Even if these lower your cholesterol, the offsetting risk to your triglycerides might negate the heart healthy benefits.  I'm no expert on this, but I find that eating too many sugars only makes me hungrier.<br /><br />If you like to have spreads on your breads and are using stanols as part of your heart health regimen, I'd suggest a tub of Benecol or Smart Balance instead!<br /><br />Benecol - can you bring me stanols in a capsule without the sugar?
