Not even sure if this is really Dill Weed????? These look like crushed mint leaves or just plain crushed leaves, dill weed looks feathery and the smell and taste is VERY distinct. This item is NOT. Don't waste your money. I think if someone were to have left dill weed out open subjected to the elements for 10 years, that would have more aroma and taste than this product does. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY
