The item description is incorrect. The actual package says "Tang Energy FROZEN Beverage Drink Mix". Directions are for a GRANITA STYLE MACHINE that makes slushies TWO gallons at a time. All I wanted was a Tang Energy Drink Mix. I've been experimenting to discover the right portions for a water bottle, no luck. So I really can't speak to the Energy Boost, B Vitamins OR Caffeine, BUT I can speak to the weak lemonade flavor described by the other reviewer...he's right!<br /><br />I was expecting Tang with an energy kick. What I got was some pretty expensive flavored water you have STILL doctor up with inconsistent results ... 1 STAR and a SNAP!
