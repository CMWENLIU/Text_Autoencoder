Upon receiving the KTC mustard oil, we noticed that the label said for external use only.  As the product was listed with other "gourmet food items" we had assumed that this was a mustard flavored food oil.  Not a mustard Seed oil.  There is a big difference and one that could be dangerous if not noted.  The Amazon ad did not relate any warnings or ingredient list that I could find, that would have helped me avoid purchasing the wrong item.
