I've tried some of the Tasty Bite meal kits and found the veggie curry quite tasty, so I bought these on a whim. The flavor is very flat - simply peanut, but not fragrant peanut, more like jarred peanut butter. Tried it on tofu skewers and beef skewers. Not so great.  I used about 1/2 of one pouch and couldn't figure out what to do with the rest. It sat in the refrigerator until it molded. Now I'm stuck with 5 packs. Not horrible, but I prefer the stuff from Trader Joe's.
