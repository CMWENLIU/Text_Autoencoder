I think the allergy statement on this page is REALLY MISLEADING.  It only warns about peanuts and tree nuts, when actually the package also mentions a number of other allergens that these sunflower seeds were exposed to.  If there was no allergen statement, I would have contacted the manufacturer to find out the allergen statement for this product.  But because there is allergen info in the description on Amazon, I assumed that it was the complete list, so I went ahead and ordered these, only to find out that actually these "may contain" wheat and other allergens.  My family is very allergic to wheat.  So now we've got a ton of useless sunflower seeds.  I think the description of this product should contain either a current allergen listing, or no allergen listing, but not an incomplete one -- that's misleading.
