I really feel it is not the flavor that is causing the problem; it tastes rotten so I'm wondering if the packager let some part of the juice sit out too long.  I haven't had a problem with VitaCoco products prior to this so I really think that is what happened.  I am also concerned because these comments have not been addressed by the company.  In my opinion, these should be recalled.
