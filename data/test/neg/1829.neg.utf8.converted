The total net carbs is NOT Zero. According the label on the package Total carb is less than 1g, that could be .999999. It is NOT Zero. Amazon would not take a return on this item, but they did refund me the complete order price.<br /><br />If you want a true zero carb product, this is not it.<br /><br />Also there is zero fiber listed , so nothing to offset the carbs.<br />Strange since the description says it is made only from the soluble fiber of the plant.
