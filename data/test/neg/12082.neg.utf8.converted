I ordered a six pack of Greenies Pill Pockets from EntirelyPets in 2010, from this page in Amazon (I know it was this page because it pops up one of those "you already bought this" notices), and received the Greenies brand.  Since then, however, the photo has been changed to a generic brand pill pocket (I can't enlarge it enough to see what brand, but it isn't Greenies), and EntirelyPets is no longer on the vendor list.  The Greenies photos are from a customer uploading photos, probably from back when the official photo was also Greenie brand.  The reviews, I am almost certain, are from when this page sold the Greenies brand name.  The description no longer calls these "Greenies"-- it doesn't say what brand they are at all.  These generics may be just as good, I don't know.  But I do know that as of April, 2011, there are less expensive 6 packs, which are definitely Greenies brand, on other Amazon pages.  Just wanted to give a heads up in case people didn't know what the Greenies package looked like.
