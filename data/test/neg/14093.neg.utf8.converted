I bought this product because I thought it was CHEESE ravioli, but it has MEAT sauce in it. We are vegetarians so we were not able to use the 15 bowls of these I bought on Amazon. I had to give them to a charity. Amazon should clearly state in the product description that these are Cheese Ravioli's in MEAT sauce!
