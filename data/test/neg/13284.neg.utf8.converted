You are paying $16.55 for 20 small (really small) packages that a kid could swallow in one bite if he wanted to. I have no idea how this item got so many positive reviews.  Was very tempted to give it 1 star, but the product does taste good and is healthy, but 1400 calories for $16.55, you have to be kidding me Annie!
