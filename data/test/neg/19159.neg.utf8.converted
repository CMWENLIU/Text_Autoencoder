I saw an add on TV for these and then read some reviews on the net (some good some bad). I bought a case of these and wish I hadn't. The sauce tastes terrible (vinegary) and the noodles look, feel, and taste like plastic. Let's be honest here, this IS a crappy microwaveable lunch so I wasn't expecting anything great. I was still EXTREMELY disappointed. I have no idea how a product like this is out on the market. Didn't they do any panel taste tests?
