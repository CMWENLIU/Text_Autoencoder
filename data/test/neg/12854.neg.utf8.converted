Capachino is to have some milk in it, flavor and coffee, this is just flavored coffee. I do not see how they can eve call it capachino? This has no milk at all (my package of Kcups didn't). The coffee is OK but since it claims to be capachino I give it one star because it does not even vaguely taste like capachino.
