If you are looking for a rice substitute-don't try this one! You'd be better off using brown rice if you are looking for a healthy alternative.<br /><br />The horrible smell aside, this was very very slippery and gooey. I tried it in a "rice dish" and the consistency was more soup like than rice like. Although it took on the flavor of the dish I made, it did not absorb as rice does and the whole thing was a fishy, sloppy slimy mess.<br /><br />I have had the noodles and they are OK but this product-YUCK!
