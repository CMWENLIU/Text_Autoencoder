Notice:  This is my first BAD review!!! The ease of use of this product is great.  BUT there is not even 1/2 teaspoon of vegetables and beef combined in the liquid called vegetable beef.  It is really more like watered down brown gravy--DON'T waste your money!! After opening one can, I threw the other seven into the garbage.  And, the one I opened, I poured down the garbage disposal.  Sorry for the review but Campbell's really did mess up on this and should take it off the market!!!
