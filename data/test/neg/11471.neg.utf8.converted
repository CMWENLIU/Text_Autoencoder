I try to buy this flowers for my mother .<br />The site says "order it in the next 4 minutes if you want to ensure the delivery by may 29."<br />It was two days earlier than the real date I was interested, but I go for it.<br />I place the order, and the next saturday (may 30) I write to them because the flowers does not show up, asking if they can't send it on sunday i should place an order with a diferent suplier...anyway the wrote to me the next monday: Your order was already cancel.<br />I wrote them again and tell them that, as they don't answer to me, I asume that they are actually sending the flowers and I have nothing, so please, send it anyway...<br />Thay reply: Your order was not delivery, and It will never be delivered.<br />So rude
