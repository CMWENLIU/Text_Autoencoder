I bought my Hellmann's mayonnaise at the local grocery (Indiana), expiry date April 2012.  It was also bad when opened - it tasted super-vinegary and just "off," and I have been using Hellmann's for many years.  I don't know if they have changed the formula or what, but I threw out a much-anticipated BLT sandwich because I had put Hellmann's on it.  If they have changed the recipe, they REALLY need to go back to the old one.  I won't ruin any more family recipes by using Hellmann's if they don't.
