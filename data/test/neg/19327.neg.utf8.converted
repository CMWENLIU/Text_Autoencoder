As one of the previous reviewer, I'm a tea drinker, always straight without anything else. At first I thought this was coffee mixed with tea and not being a coffee fan that did not resonate well.<br />But then realized that this is just ground tea. However it's not even tea. I had not heard about this South African plant before, but it's not tea even though the smell and taste remind me of a very dark, steeped for too long and too bitter black tea.<br />I did try with the recommended serving size, 4 spoons, and then reduced as this is really dark. They only show it on the packaging drunk with milk or cream or fruit juice. I only tried it like I like tea, so without anything and it's too strong/bold/powerful... it's not a complex taste, just quite ... raw.<br /><br />I find the idea attractive for people who want to quit drinking coffee (hence the not just 1 star) but this is not for me :)
