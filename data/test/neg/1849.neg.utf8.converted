I've been purchasing this product for a year now. It used to be very creamy and thick, it was great. The last few shipments it has been watered down to the point where it's not enjoyable and the cans are dented to the point where they are difficult to open. I no longer use it in my coffee which is a shame, and I can't make coconut ice cream which used to be amazing. I'm looking for an alternative as I have no other choice but to cancel my subscribe and save. I'm thinking about replacing it with coconut cream as it is difficult to find BPA Free canned coconut milk.
