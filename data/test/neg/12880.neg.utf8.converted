Be aware if you buy this that it is INSTANT COFFEE. I purchased this at WalMart because the price was so much better than regular K-cups. I brought it home and tried it - awful coffee when you are expecting a cup of fresh brewed coffee.  I contacted Grove Square Customer service to c/o what appears to be deception but got no response. I also contacted Keurig and they did reply saying they were aware of the product and that Keurig was in "talks" with Grove Square about this since Grove Square apparently is not authorized to sell this coffee as a Kcup coffee and the coffee was NOT recommended by Keurig.  I feel if you pay >100$$ for a brewer it isn't to brew instant coffee. I too, like one other reviewer, removed the top after "brewing" my cup of coffee and found absolutely nothing but coffee colored water.  What an absolute disappointment this is.
