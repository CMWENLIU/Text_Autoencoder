I LOVE foie gras in pretty much any form, however its honestly not for anyone on a budget or middle class for sure. I decided to go with grade B because of the $30 difference. I assumed it with just be veinier. It was veinier but also lacked that great earthy duck taste that you get with grade A and with the canned product. I felt like i was eating chicken liver or something. It wasnt worth the price. I suggest you continue to splurge on grade A. But if you are making a pate' then grade B might suffice- hope this helps
