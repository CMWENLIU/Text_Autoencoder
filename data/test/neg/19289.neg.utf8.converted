Not trilled maybe sad. There were 28 coffees and 7 teas nothing else. I thought I'd get a selection. I wanted to try cocoa and apple cider but as many here have said there is no variety. There were 35 different products both dark coffee and medium. There were 6 flavored coffees and 4 decaf coffees. But not the wide variety I had expected. Also although I have not used the product yet, as I have not been delivered the coffee maker, I'm wondering how they will taste as the cups are old. Several of them are puffed up. I don't think they will be poison, but old coffee is not flavorful. Don't buy this product or maybe you're just into Russian roulette.<br />Just went from 2 stars to 1. I ordered the Bed Bath and Beyond 60 samples for $39.00, and while their selection was just OK, a 3.5 star rating. Its .66c a k-cup while this is .75c, BB&B's selections where fresher and there was some variety. OK I ordered more so the price was better but let me tell you the whole presentation was better, the product was better, fresher and I think it has this beat by 2.5 stars.
