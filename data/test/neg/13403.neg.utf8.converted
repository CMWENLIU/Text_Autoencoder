I have to disagree with the previous reviewer; I don't think this tastes anything like the original Parmesano flavor - it more closely resembles library paste or something to my tastebuds.  I think the Angel Hair Parmesan has a flavor that is kind of close to Parmesano, but something is missing - I can't tell what.  Noodle Roni Parmesano was my very favorite comfort food, and I miss it a lot.  *sigh*
