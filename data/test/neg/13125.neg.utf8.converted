Did anyone realize that this so-called beneficial water costs WAY MORE then gasoline? It cost $23.04 a gallon for this water..! What was I thinking when I bought and tried it? I just got caught up on the RHWNJ hype and lost my mind and money in the meantime. We complain about the $4.00+ a gallon high gas prices but some of us bought into this horrible BLK water hype. Fortunately I only bought one to try. BTW..it's horrible and nasty tasting. Save your money and use regular tap water or regular bottled water, your wallet will be much happier.
