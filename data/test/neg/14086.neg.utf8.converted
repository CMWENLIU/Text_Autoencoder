This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of anything online.  I'll submit the same to French's as well.  It is disappointing that they have ruined a Holiday staple for the sake of saving money.  I hope their sales declines and forces the return of the original packaging.  The new plastic containers add a strong chemical or plastic taste.  It seems to burn off during cooking but those of us that love to eat straight from the container are left with a horrible after taste.  I also can't help but to feel like the product is poisoning us some how...if I can taste the chemical then it surely is going into my body.  I just hope it's not being absorbed.  Please bring back the original container.
