The price was cheap & so was the product. These rawhide bones literally disinegrated into a thousand small shards, occasionally causing my Golden to gag on them. I don't feel that i got my money's worth, because they would break up & be gone in 10 minutes, rather than giving hours of enjoyment. I had to vacuum the floor every time he had one. I bought better ones @ Costco. I give him these cheap, junk, ones, to have, only in the yard
