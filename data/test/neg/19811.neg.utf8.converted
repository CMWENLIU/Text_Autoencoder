.....SUBTITLE:  READ THE E N T I R E....DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY OF ANYTHING<br />  YOU BUY!<br /><br />JUICY JUICE has a reputation for being 100% juice.  Always!  No additives, preservatives....and even no extra sweeteners!  It is<br />also often regarded as a children's beverage -- and to me, that<br />means the manufacturers have taken EXTRA care that the product is<br />as good as can be.  After all, no manufacturer wants to be accused<br />of giving health problems, (now or in the future), or even out-<br />right poisoning, children!  To me, a product specifically made for<br />children, (and/or usually associated with children's eating or<br />drinking it), is often, (but not always), an inexpensive way to get<br />gourmet -- or almost gourmet -- quality food at a good price.<br /><br />I've had Juicey Juice before...and enjoyed it immensely.  But -- the<br />Juicy Juice I have heretofore imbibed was the "real McCoy", (no, no<br />-- NOT the Chief Medical Officer of the original Star Ship 'Enter-<br />prise' -- but 'real McCoy" as in the "genuine article".  THAT Juicey<br />Juice, (forget which flavour), came in a large BOTTLE, and had to be<br />REFRIGERATED.  But wow....did it taste good!  : ),<br /><br />Yet, any bottled juice contains a LOT of water.  So -- why not buy the<br />concentrate, and add your OWN water?  It should cost less this way --<br />why spend money on water you can get out of a tap for, (almost) free?<br />(Excluding the ubiquitous water tax, in most instances.)  As I<br />trust only my own, home-made distilled water, buying the concentrated<br />Juicey Juice seemed to make sense two ways -- if not three.  (1. I<br />used my own home-distilled water, 2.) Ounce for ounce, re-constituted<br />concentrate HAS to cost less than juice in big bottles and 3.)  It left<br />more room in my refrigerator....AND on my shelf.<br /><br />For this is not the usual FROZEN concentrate, you see.  It is "un-frozen<br />concentrate."  That doesn't need to take up valuable space in the<br />freezer -- or even the refrigerator, at least till it is opened. On top<br />of all this, it is all-natural Juicey Juice.  How could I resist THIS<br />bargain?  How could I miss with it?<br /><br />Well -- as soon as I opened up a can, (admittedly fitted with a very<br />convenient flip-top), diluted it as per instructions, and tasted it --<br />I KNEW I had "missed".  And missed Big-Time.  The flavour was absolutely<br />AWFUL!  It tasted as if MEDICINE, on top of the WORST-tasting of CHEMICALS, including a LARGE dollop of MACHINE OIL!  I definitely believe it could send many crewmen TO Dr. McCoy's sickbay on Star Trek.  It surely made ME feel sick!  I was also shocked and saddened.  In oomplete disbelief, I looked at the ingredient label again.  It said:<br /><br />  Apple Juice Concentrate<br />  Water<br />  Grape Juice Concentrate<br />  Natural Flavors<br />  Raspberry Juice Concentrate<br />  Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)<br />  Citric Acid<br /><br />Nope -- nothing wrong with the ingredients.  No motor oil, either. The<br />ingredients -- they were all natural, as always advertised.  And this is a juice usually served to CHILDREN!  Cofusion<br />mixed with great disappointment filled my mind.  I began to wonder<br />about the poisons I have heard that occur naturally.  Poisoned mush-<br />rooms, perhaps?  But no mushroom of any sort was listed amongst the<br />ingredients.....<br /><br />Were my taste-buds going into pre-mature old age, perhaps?  SOMETHING<br />has to go first, according to the popular view.  NOBODY reaches 90<br />without SOME loss of faculties -- or almost nobody, anyway, so most people suppose. I guess I've been lucky in meeting mostly youthfully<br />-minded and spirited 90+ year-olds in my life. But not everyone is that way, even I must admit.  But YIKES....I'm nowhere NEAR 90. (yet, anyway.)<br />I sighed.  Better my taste-buds go first, than my eyes, or my legs...<br /><br />I tried drinking it straight.  Then, more diluted than was called for.  Ulgh, and double ulgh.  Then with the proper 3 cans of water to one can of Juicy Juice dilution.  Ulgh!  No matter how I tried to make it, the flavor didn't improve.  At all.... ):<br /><br />Still disbelieving, I looked again, this time VERY CAREFULLY at the label.  And I noticed something written there I hadn't noticed before.<br />T H I S....P R O D U C T....I S....P A S T E U R I Z E D..( ! )  Not even written in small lettering -- but this notice WAS below all the other information on the label....<br /><br />Pasteurized!  In common slang, "nuked". I suppose, being a NON-FROZEN<br />ooncentrate, SOMETHING had to be done to the Juicey Juice to keep it fresh.  I've heard that Vitamin E makes a dandy preservative -- but it probably is MUCH more expensive than nuking -- excuse me, pasteurizing! -- the Juicey Juice.  I mean, pasteurization really doesn't harm the juice, as far as health considerations go.  But -- it DOES make the juice taste like motor oil -- and USED motor oil at that!<br /><br />So, I guess I'll go back to either regular bottled juice, (including bottled Juicey Juice), or FROZEN concenrate.  (As much as admire the tv series ALIEN NATION, with Tenctonese aliens who drink sour milk, eat newspapers, and adore cooking all kinds of bugs -- this unfrozen Juicy Juice concentrate is NOT to my (Human) taste.  Sorry.  Then again -- I wonder if even a fictional Tenctonese, (and former slave), could stomache this stuff either.  Motor oil is NOT something evem the Tenctonese imbibed on the show.......<br /><br />I wish the taste of Juicy Juice Non-Frozen concentrate could be changed.<br />But I doubt whether even a pound of sugar in each 11.5 ounce can could help.  (Before buying this, I was disappointed to see an extra .5 ounce had been eliminated from the usual 12 ounce can.  But after drinking the stuff, I was immeasurably grateful it had been taken off!<br /><br />I knew I could not throw it out.  I had paid money for it, and I was not brought up to be wasteful.<br /><br />Yes, I knew I had bought this....this ....stuff...and the taste was....well, on a score of<br />1-10, it was about a 3...so I knew I could, and would, finish all 12<br />bottles of concentrate, for I was not brought up to waste things.<br />However......no one was telling me I had to drink them quickly.  Pain<br />is sometimes better when it's spread out.  Maybe....I could stretch<br />this stuff out, drinking a few ounces a week, to lessen the pain of<br />drinking it all at once?  Maybe drinking it while watching my favourite cable channel -- the SyFy channel -- would lessen the blow....?  No, I suddenly thought -- drinking this horrible-tasting liquid whilst watching the SyFy channel, of all things, was definitely NOT a good idea.  Maybe....I could take it better watching a comedy?  A musical?  Or better yet, a musical comedy?  Then, THE perfect time to drink this this...juice...came to me.  The time when I felt not worse, not scared -- but at my best.  The day AFTER I file my income taxes!  And maybe on my birthday, and the 4th of July....when my happiness could, perahps, overwhelm the complete awfulness of the taste of this...this...stuff. Maybe I could pass it off on some friends, during a Halloween party?  No -- I like and value my friends to pass THIS stuff onto them.  Hmmm....maybe as a "gift", should I ever need to give one, to my ex-brother-in-law?  (This guy once told me: "You are 6 years younger than I am, and I'll never forgive you for it", amongst other choice morsels.  He has always had a chip on his shoulder as big as the Grand Canyon.)  Hmmm...maybe not. If I give him THIS, that chip on his shoulder may get as big as a crater on the moon!...<br /><br />It's amazing how GOOD regular, bottled Juicy Juice can taste -- and how totally awful this unfrozen concentrate is.  But at least I know the reason WHY now.  The old poem has it WRONG: "Their's was not to reason why, their's was just to drink....er, do....or die."  I looked at the can, and I now KNOW why it tastes so BAD.  (The information about this concentrate being pasteurized is also on the Amazon description of it,<br />but it is NOT highlighted, so it's easy to pass by.)<br /><br />Well, live and learn.  Hey.............I've got it!  Instead of executing criminals, they should have to drink this stuff, at every meal, for a year.  I don't think every criminal will beg for the death penalty after this....but many surely will!
