I was very disappointed with this one. Most of the cream soup bases I've checked with online state simple water for the base, this one calls for milk, flour, water, + base! I may as well have made it from scratch. The instructions specifically call for 1/2 cup base, 1/4 cup flour and 1 full cup of milk to get a "thin" sauce so "makes  50 servings" of cream soup or gravy is not possible in an 8oz container. I contacted seller for a refund and was prompted to print out a return label which could have been provided w/ the sales slip I never received either. The only response received was to my feedback. They never tried to resolve anything with me and for that I would not purchase from this seller again
