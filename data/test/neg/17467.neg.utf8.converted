First off, I think what Honest Kitchen is doing is great.<br />But, I think they have some more work to do on the cat food.<br />The cats were just not interested.<br /><br />So far, I have tried it three different times. (The box has a generous amount of food.)<br />I've made it thick, thinner and even tried adding it with a packet of their regular food.<br />As long as this was in their dish, they were on food strike.<br /><br />I could see this being good for outdoor cats, but our indoor ones totally turned their<br />backs on it.  Their favorite flavor is chicken, and I had hopes they would love it, but<br />they just don't.<br /><br />I have to give a lower star on this one.  I even tried to give away the rest, and no one<br />wanted it.  I ended up tossing it out - it was wasted.
