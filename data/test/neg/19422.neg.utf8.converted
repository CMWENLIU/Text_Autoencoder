I was so excited to get these because I thought it would be a great healthy snack to keep at my desk.  I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it.  I assumed it was a bad one in the batch.  I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives).  I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier.  The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy.  Apparently Amazon had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them.  Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.<br />I will not be ordering these again and will be wary of ordering other food products from Amazon.com.  They were great about refunding my money and I will continue to purchase from amazon, just not short shelf life food items.
