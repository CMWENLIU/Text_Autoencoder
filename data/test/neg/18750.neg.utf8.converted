I bought a pound of this Meow Mix Tender Centers for my cat at the local pet superstore near my house. And although she seems to like it, I have to give it a low rating. Here is why:<br /><br />This Meow Mix Tuna and Whitefish Cat Food is like junk food for my cat as it tastes good but has little nutritional value. It has inferior ingredients in the top 5 of the ingredients list (listed below), as well as the addition of artificial colors and controversial brewer's yeast, so no matter how much my cat might like this cat food, I really had to give it a low rating.<br /><br />To start with, the first two ingredients on the list are ground corn and corn meal. These supply no essential vitamins or nutrients to my cat's diet. Chicken by-product comes next, which is a less than ideal form of protein as it is made up of the bits of the chicken that are unfit for human consumption. Salmon meal and fishmeal do provide better forms of protein, but they are not the main ingredients and do not provide a satisfactory amount of protein for a healthy cat. Furthermore, the artificial colors are unnecessary, and the addition of brewer's yeast can cause allergies in cats.<br /><br />Meow Mix, a subsidiary of Del Monte, could have come up with something better!<br /><br />Top 5 Ingredients:<br />1. Ground yellow corn<br />2. Corn gluten meal<br />3. Chicken by-product meal<br />4. Soybean meal<br />5. Beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of Vitamin E)
