I switched our 10 week old kitten from Science Diet Kitten to Wellness Kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her. The shelter first said she never had diarrhea, then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up. So we are dealing with the unknown. Two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food-related. This kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble (Purina Pro Plan Kitten) I did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs. And I also stopped the Wellness dry as it has grains. The diarrhea has lessened, but it's been 2 weeks now & I'm still stumped. I did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food, and also include a capsule of probiotics (spread out over 4 daily meals). She had a more formed stool today, so maybe she's turning the corner.<br /><br />I also question Wellness putting vegetables/fruits in this kitten food! These are NOT foods cats would eat in the wild. Is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health? That would be the ultimate con job. I truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies, so Wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats.<br /><br />In fact, almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends!<br />I will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten, and another kitten, adopted a week later, from a different litter (and w/no digestive issues - she was/still is being fed Petsmart brand Authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains/corn, but I won't switch her as her digestion works great on it)<br /><br />Wellness came highly recommended to me, but my search for a grain-free/veggie/fruit-free/wheat-free kitten dry kibble continues....so Wellness Kitten kibble is off my list. I will try their canned Kitten formula but not easy to find thus far.
