I just received my order yesterday, from a very unhappy UPS driver. As I discovered, the jar does not come with a film seal or shrink-wrap or anything. Just the lid screwed on. Which probably contains the butter just fine in lower temperatures. But with the 100 degree heat we've been experiencing the last few days, the butter melted and oozed out of the jar all over the package, through the cardboard box and apparently onto other packages in the delivery truck. I don't know how much butter I lost in the process, but it's certainly not worth the mess to attempt getting more right now. It smelled nice, and based on other reviews, I'm sure it will work just fine for the projects I have in mind. But I will certainly keep in mind to order it during cooler months, and never try it in July again!
