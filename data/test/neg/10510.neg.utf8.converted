The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers.  I purchased this rabbit for my daughter, as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls.  To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh.  Totally unsuitable for cuddling.  It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it.  Well not this guy!  Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more.  I will not be purchasing another Cloverdale whole animal, and I suggest that none of you do either.  If we continue to accept these practices, things will only become worse!  What's next, Cloverdale?  Bears with claws?<br /><br />*EDIT*  It has come to my attention that this animal is intended to be either frozen or consumed immediately at time of receipt.  I believe Amazon should be more thorough in their descriptions of products such as this!  I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that people will be buying this animal for reasons other than consumption.  Until Amazon changes their description, I will stand by my 1 star rating!
