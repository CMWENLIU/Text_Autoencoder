My cats were SO excited about the smell of this food, but eating it made them vomit instantly. I understand that you need to introduce new foods very carefully and gradually, so it wasn't because I switched them over cold turkey. Even when they were getting only a dollop mixed with their typical food, the vomiting persisted with both cats. THK has worked well for our dog, but if it won't stay down for more than 5 minutes, something is definitely wrong with the cat formula.
