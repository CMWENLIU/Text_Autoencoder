So I got a case of this stuff because I was curious as to what clementine juice might taste like. I got it, took a swig...and found it to be OK, if a little odd...I then looked at the side of the can to see how much clementine juice is in the can. Here is, verbatim, the ingredients list:<br /><br />"Pure juice made from white grape, apple, lemon and orange juice concentrates, sparkling water, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium citrate, gum arabic, beta carbotene (color), ascorbic acid (vitamic C),  glycerol ester or rosin, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitimin B6)."<br /><br />See anything odd about that ingredients list? Look carefully...What's missing? How about clementine juice?!!? Not a spec of it. Talk about smoke and mirrors. "All natural"? Maybe. But lots of cheap juice and none of the namesake? Give me a break. I've been had. Don't make the same mistake.
