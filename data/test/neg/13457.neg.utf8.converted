Don't order these! When i ordered these, I was so looking forward to some delcious Mallo cups. The ones I received were old, discolored, and looked they had been in a warehouse for years. I tried one, but it tasted as bad as it looked. I promptly tossed the whole shipment. What a waste! All was not lost, though. I read here that they were at Dollar Tree and I'm enjoying some good ones now as I write this review.
