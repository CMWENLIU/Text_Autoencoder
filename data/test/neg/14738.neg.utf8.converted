I needed this chocolate for a specific event.  I paid over $30 for shipping TO HAVE THIS DELIVERED ON TIME.<br />The item arrived THE DAY AFTER the event.<br /><br />Fortunately, my chef had acquired better chocolate ON TIME ELSEWHERE.<br /><br />I will never order anything time sensitive through you again.
