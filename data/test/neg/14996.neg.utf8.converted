I've been making lots of dirty martinis lately,so I thought I would try out olive juice brine since I go through olive juice in the jar very quickly.  I wasn't impressed with the product,not only did it not taste very good,but it also used more than expected,so the bottle wouldn't have lasted long.  I also purchased the Dirty Sue martini mix,I haven't tried that one yet.  If you like the taste of a dirty martini you would drink if ordered at a nice bar/restaurant then this product would not be satisfying.
