The first shipment was stale.  The second case was not as stale but stale nonetheless.  I'm not sure if it is staleness or just plain grossness.  I like other chips by Garden of Eatin'.  Will the birds eat them?  What do I do with all these chips?  Amazon was great about sending me a replacement when I complained about the first case.
