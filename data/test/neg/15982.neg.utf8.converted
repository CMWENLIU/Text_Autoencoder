I ordered these based upon the claim that these were imported from Japan. False! This product is licensed to be produced in Hong Kong and sold in cheaper markets, including the US. It would never be imported into Japan and therefore, never exported from there.<br /><br />How do they taste? If these were supposed to be Pringles, they taste as if they were called Prangels. They are close but not as good and disappointingly less satisfying than expected from the original.<br /><br />Food is only as good as it's ingredients. Local resources goes into producing this ramen in Hong Kong and differ in taste and quality from the original. If this cheaper version was identical to the Japan produced Nissin noodles, the version sold in Japan would be imported from Hong Kong instead of being still made in Japan. People in Japan will know the difference and are wary of the quality, as am I.<br /><br />A Mercedes Benz made in Germany is different in quality from one made in another country. I expect honesty in the origin of a product. These noodles are misrepresented. While the noodles are edible, the untruth is unforgivable. If you want the Hong Kong version, then you can enjoy the noodles sold here but I could buy the HK version locally for much less. I'm willing to pay more for real Japanese ramen but, not this.<br /><br />I know I can return this ramen but, that would not change how I feel and someone else will be fooled so, this review would remain the same. I want real instant Nissin Demae Iccho ramen that is made in Japan. This is not it.
