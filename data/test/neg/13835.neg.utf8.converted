I love the idea of this product but I am definitely doing something wrong. I've tried 3 seed kits and I haven't had a terrific amount of luck. If all that you're interested in is basil, you have it made. Not much else seems to grow very well. My chives were a failure as were my purple basil, cilantro, and parsley. I called and complained to the company and they were kind enough to send to me another seed pack. The sweet basil flourished but everything else pretty much floundered.<br /><br />Truth be told, I would recommend growing your own basil, parsley, rosemary, cilantro, and chives during the warmer months. If you're fortunate enough to live in a large city, you can buy herbs from your grocery store for a relatively low price during the off seasons. I live in Houston and our Central Market sells organic herbs for $.99/bunch. I wrap my herbs in paper towels and bag them in plastic bags the day that I purchase them. They last for a few weeks. I definitely get my money's worth without having to spend a bundle on an Aerogarden. One caveat though, buy basil and use it within 3-4 days. It's great in salads too!
