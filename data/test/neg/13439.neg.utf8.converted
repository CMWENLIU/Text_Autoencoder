We love curry and Indian food, Moroccon food, all types of dishes from different cultures and anything from anywhere that goes on rice. I've bought many dishes from Kitchens of India but this one just fell flat.  My first and last impression was "slimy".  I cooked it in the microwave and the boil water method and both were inedible to me and every one of my family.  It's like a pureed slime with only about 3 chunks of cheese and a few small tidbits more.  Not a pleasant taste or texture, little food value, way too high in salt..makes this something I'll never purchase again.  I will continue with Kitchens of India, however, as they do have some tasty dishes.
