Sorry, but this product is NOT HEALTHY. The word "organic" only means that the ingredients were grown with out certain chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones. So if you must eat Kraft mac-n-cheese, this is a better choice than regular. But, the word "organic" does not mean nutritious! Boxed mac-n-cheese isn't a nutritious choice for growing kids and, organic or not, it's a highly processed food (hint: it still has powered cheese). This food is very high in saturated fat and sodium. Plus, it doesn't contain any whole grains. Kids would be much better off getting their protein and calcium, which this product does contain, from foods not so high in saturated fats! Almost all kids really will eat, and even enjoy, whole-grain pasta, lower fat milk, 2% cheese and many other truly nutritious foods when parents make (or buy) easy, yummy and kid-friendly healthy choices!<br />P.Gould, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family
