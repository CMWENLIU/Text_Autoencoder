My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.
