You either Like Tim Burton or you don't,I fall in the latter.BeetleJuice is not a big deal for me despite it's huge following and Burton's Following,While there are funny moments I am not the type to like Alice In Wonderland type films that are "trippy".I think the Highlight for Me Is Robert Goulet(Goulet!robert gouleeeeeeeeet!)and Wionna Ryder,I can't stand Baldwin.
