Taro is a purple potato that has a very subtle taste normally.  When it's combined with a creamy and sweet flavor, its taste gets enhanced substantially to get something very unique and pleasant.<br /><br />This is the typical brand carried at many Asian markets.  Except, most Asian markets sell them for $2.00, $3.00 at most.  $10.00 is highway robbery.<br /><br />Bottom line: taste alone, this gets 5 stars.  At $10.00, rating drops down to 2 stars.
