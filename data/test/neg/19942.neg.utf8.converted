This soup is only edible which isn't much of a compliment.  I found myself using it then trying to disguise it's taste (note the word "trying").  It's not worth it.  Try Amy's instead if you're not gluten intolerant.  It's blows the other c of m soups out of the water.<br />If I were you (and gluten intolerant but okay w/ dairy) I'd grab a carton of chicken broth, saute a box of portobello's, toss them into a blender to get the consistency you want, heat it and dress it up w/ whatever flavoring you desire.  Thicken it if you like.  The trick that makes it tasty is to add a cup of whipping cream at the very end and then just heat through.  It will knock your socks off!
