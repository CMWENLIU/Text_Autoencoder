Famous Amos Chocolate chip cookies have had several changes to the original recipe.  They taste NOTHING like they used to which at one time was absolutely delicious.  Not so much now... they are more like dog biscuits now.<br /><br />Changes like...from all butter to margarine to mixed oils.... maybe the next version will be petroleum based. They now have no brown sugar, the eggs are almost non-existent as well as any good taste.<br /><br />Avoid eating these "cookies" if they are still available.
