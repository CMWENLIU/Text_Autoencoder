Judging by the extremes of the reviews, I'm guessing there is a bad batch or one of the warehouses is subject to extreme conditions that degrade the product. I opened one bottle out of the batch of 3 so far. I'll try the others, and post my opinion if it changes.<br /><br />I read the reviews and took a gamble that it was a bad batch and I might get a good batch.
