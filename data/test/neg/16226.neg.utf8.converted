I ordered the bulk 12.5 lb bag of Paragon popcorn on August 12, 2011, thinking that it was reasonable priced and would go well with the microwave popper and the air popper I was also ordering from Amazon.  Some Reviewers had noted that what they had received was stale;  they were right, the popcorn tasted alfully funny and barely popped in the microwave popper, at least a third of what I had cooked were unpopped duds.  In the air popper, I did get better results, but still had a lot of partially popped kernels (aka, "tooth breakers" as I had to be extreemly careful at the bottom of the bowl).<br /><br />I was going to try making a batch tonight, I noticed a dark kernel in the mix;  it had mold on it.  Some of the other kernels look suspecious, too;  my overall impression of the cooked corn, and the weathered plastic bag the entire 12.5 lb batch came in, is that it's completly stale and too old to use.<br /><br />I expect 12.5 lb bags of corn are not selling that fast, and are getting stale in the warehouse.  Anyone who wants a decent bag of popping corn would be better off just picking-up a bag at the grocery store;  at least those bags are freshness-labeled with a date, this Paragon corn was complely undated and no telling how old it was.  Terrible!!<br /><br />**UPDATE** 11-OCT-2011  - I tossed all the stale Paragon corn last week in the trash, decided it wasn't worth dealing with if it was moldy, stale, and wouldn't completly pop.  Last weekend, I tried a new *freshness dated* bag of Kroger yellow popping corn in my new air popper;  that did perfect, there were about 5 unpopped kernels remaining (compared to the over two dozen unpopped kernnels from the Paragon corn).  No more unsealed food products from Amazon for me after this experience.
