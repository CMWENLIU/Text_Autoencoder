As the previous reviewer stated, I also received one measly box of 16 pop tarts for $27.  Wow, those are some expensive pop tarts!  ;)  When I called Amazon to rectify the situation it took a 45 minute call trying to explain to the CS rep that no one in their right mind would pay $1.69 PER pop tart.  They finally assured me they would send me the correct order.  So I waited....and whaddaya know....once again recieved one box.  LOL  I called again and had to go through the whole 45 minute convo again explaining how much a pop tart *should* cost.  This CS told me he couldn't resend, but would just refund my money.  Thank heavens.  My blood pressure couldn't take another delivery!
