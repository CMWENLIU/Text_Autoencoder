I really didn't care for this brand compared to other unrefined coconut oils I've been using. It's not USDA approved and the scent smelled artifical. The texture was heavier then most unrefined coconut oil. When I oil pulled using this brand my results were not as great either. I believe Nature's Way brand is natural but certainly not organic. I will be going back to Spectrum's brand.
