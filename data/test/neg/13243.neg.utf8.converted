I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.<br /><br />Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.<br /><br />I would be interested in other opinions.<br /><br />Sign me an unhappy customer.
