I purchased a box of these from my local grocery store for about $4.50 ... which I thought was a bit pricy so I came home and looked on Amazon to see if anyone was selling them cheaper.  Imagine my glee when I saw this price ...<br />24 for $49.99.  24 boxes for $49.99 comes to about $2.08 each .... except there was a problem.  I didn't get 24 boxes.  I got 4 boxes w/ 6 cookie bars which equals 24.  If you do the math, that comes to $12.50 per box. Girl Scout cookies don't cost that much! (YET ANYWAY!)<br />I quickly called Amazon, I was told this was the price.  I told them I wanted to return them and get a full refund.  No problem, we'll do you one better: keep the cookies and we'll refund you the full price.  I LOVE Amazon.  But, someone definitely dropped the ball on this one.  To charge $12.50 for a box of 6 cookie bars is highway robbery.  BEWARE Amazon Customers!
