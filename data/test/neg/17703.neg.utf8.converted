Why why why ruin this product with "evaporated cane juice" and palm oil -- among the most unhealthy oils -- pure saturated fat!  Almond butter, due to its monounsaturated fats and ldl cholesterol, can and should be a very nutritious substitute for peanut butter and even butter. That's why people buy it (aside from its amazing flavor)!  What are these people thinking?  So disappointing (and gross).  I don't know if I can give this stuff away.
