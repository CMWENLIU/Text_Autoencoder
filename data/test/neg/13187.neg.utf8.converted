I'm a man. As a man, I lead people to believe that I don't mind pain. A few exfoliating micro-globules? Bring 'em on!<br /><br />Yet, in reality, it's all a ruse. I don't like pain! My skin is as delicate as the petal of a calla lily, and I like my body wash to roll gently off me like morning dew. In contrast, this Dove Men body wash is less like morning dew, and more like shrapnel from an IED.<br /><br />Look, I know we Men CLAIM to be manly and strong. But we don't much like bathing with shrapnel. Exfoliating beads? We'll leave that to you ladies.<br /><br />GRADE: 1.5 MAN POINTS
