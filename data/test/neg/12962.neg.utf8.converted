These apricots are not sweet. They are also crunchy. I did not care for them. I happened to try really good apricots before. Dried apricots are good when they are sweet, juicy and soft ( but not crunchy ). Crunchy means they were not ripe enough when picked. The only good thing about these apricots - they are not sour.
