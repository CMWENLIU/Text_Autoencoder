I ordered this honey along with many others and have to say it is unique. No other honey comes close to this strangely dark goo. My first thought when I opened the jar that contained this semi-solid honey was that I had been duped and was sent something rotten. It honestly smelled like something you would not willingly eat. But I went ahead and tried it anyway. It tasted like dirt at first and was not sweet at all. After a second or so the flavor changed to a heavy sweet like dark honeys usually taste like.<br />I now realize that when the product description mentions "an earthy peat moss flavor with a bright finish", all it means is that it will taste like dirt with a slight bitterness and then turn sweeter. Unless you like odd flavors or are going to mix this with other products to create a complex flavor, I wouldn't recommend this honey to just drizzle or to eat alone.
