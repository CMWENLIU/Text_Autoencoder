When I was a wee child, both of my parents passed onwards, and baby sister and I were taken in by a band of rabbits. Momma and Daddy always managed to find the best food for us, until one day, the sun rose too high and Daddy was shot by Farmer Joe.  Farmer Joe worked for Le Village.  My daddy's on someone's dinner table now!<br /><br />Ever day since then, I have boycotted Le Village... And Farmer Joe... And the when Momma died by Snake poison soup, I assumed the role of patriarch of our Rabbit clan, beware I, King of the Hyraces!
