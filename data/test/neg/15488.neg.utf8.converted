Hi,<br /><br />I just bought a box of Naturally Sweet by Hi-Tech and found that the ingredients is different than what you have posted on your web-site.<br />THERE IS NOT "TAGATOSE".  Here are the ingredients that are listed on the box of sugar that was sent to my house, "Erythitol", "Malitol", "Maltodextrin"," Xyitol" and "Sucralose".  As you can see NO "TAGATOSE".  So, you need to change your website, you are leading the consumer astray.  SO BUYER BEWARE. . . . .I hope Hi-Tech will get its act together and stop lying to the consumer.  "Malitol" is horrible. . . .<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Cathi L. Gross<br />cathi@144web.com
