I have tried three different brands of coconut oil: Barlean's, Nutiva, and Tropical Traditions. The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the virgin coconut oil.
