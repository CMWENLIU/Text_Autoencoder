I've ordered this product from the company that manufactures it and they make you pay extra to ship it in a cool pack, because it should be kept refrigerated (which it says on the bottle). I'm an avid Amazon fan, so was thrilled to find it here. It came in a regular box, at room temperature. I returned it. Why spend that much to have it lose potency in shipping and very likely storage in the warehouse? Went back to ordering directly from Klaire Labs.
