It's true - the old Jelly Belly version of this product was superb; the new version (by the Frankford  Candy Company) is pretty bad. In the old Jelly Belly version, the flavors were picked from the books/films, and the flavors were shocking but somehow still delicious. Apparently the Frankford company took over the license, and the new beans are terrible. The flavors don't match anything from the books, and even the ones that are supposed to taste good are waxy and gross. This is a real shame. I don't think I'll be buying the Bertie Botts Beans anymore. Jelly Belly has come up with "Bean Boozled" which is a similar-themed product, and although the flavors are up to the Jelly Belly standards, it's missing the old Harry Potter themed flavors, and of course the HP packaging etc. We're out of luck on this one!
