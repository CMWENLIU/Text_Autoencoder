Recipes that work with other flour blends failed miserably with this flour blend. Sugar cookies melted and flattened in the oven and turned into hard-as-rock toffee well before the baking time was up. Zucchini bread didn't rise and ended up as a misshapen lump. Biscuits, like the sugar cookies, spread and flattened well before the baking time was up.<br /><br />I've tried and loved other flour blends. This one is only useful as a starch. I would not use it as an all-purpose flour.
