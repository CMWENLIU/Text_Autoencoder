I decided to try these as a substitute for my insatiable love of Chocolate. The reviews (and description) led me to believe that these cacao nibs are edible on their own, and a reasonably tasty alternative to what I know and love to be dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa). Alas, were that the case.<br /><br />Cacao nibs are best used as a cooking ingredient, not as a raw snack. They are edible (but not enjoyable) if you mix them into cereal/oatmeal/something else, but they are pretty much inedible eaten alone. I knew they would taste nothing like Chocolate, but I was hoping they would at least be enjoyable in their own way - turns out, they are not.<br /><br />In a nutshell, they are alternately bitter and bland, and the "chocolate" taste, to the extent it even exists, is indiscernible. Do not buy these if you love Chocolate and are seeking an alternative - buy them only if you have tried them and know what you are getting into.
