I had heard mixed reviews about the Skinny Girl Margarita "empire" but was willing to buy the White Peach margarita as I love peach margaritas! Plus, it was on Sale so I thought I would give it a try.  I wish I could get my $10 back.  It smells like peaches which was a great sign but it doesn't actually taste like peaches? Only thing I can think of is that they used artificial extract.  And I am not a mixologist but the balance is "off" - it either has way too much lime juice and/or not enough agave nectar.  It tastes bitter and harsh which are not two things a margarita should taste like! I actually had to dilute it with ice and add some sugar in the raw to make it somewhat drinkable.  For a great peach margarita, I will stick to puree-ing frozen peach slices with Jose Cuervo Light Margarita or the Costco Brand margarita.  No more Skinny Girl for this girl!
