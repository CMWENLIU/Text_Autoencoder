I bought this because I had heard that quinoa is an especially healthy grain. It also appealed to me that the gogo version is pre-cooked and RTE. Unfortunately, this product tasted terrible. I dumped one pack into a pot of chicken and rice soup, and it ruined the soup. Needless to say, I do not recommend this product. I'm still wondering what to do with the rest of the shipment.
