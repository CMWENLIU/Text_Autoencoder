I will never pay that much for a canister of Hills Bro Capp.  I pay $3.28 per canister from Walmart.  I wasn't understanding what volume of product you were getting for the price, so I clicked on the 'More Info' link.  That's absurd!! The offer for $19 plus for 3 canisters is even more insulting.  I could easily purchase 2 cans for what they're asking for 1!!  Not a good deal...
