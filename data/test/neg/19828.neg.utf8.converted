These chocolate covered coffee beans are way over priced and have a very poor taste. Several of the drops arrived in chocolate with no bean in the center. The package is cheap and not resealable. It took 11 to 12 days for this product to be shipped after receipt of order. There are much better chocolate covered coffee beans on the marget from several vendors.
