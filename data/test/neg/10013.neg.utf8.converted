A good price on this tree.  But I was disappointed when it arrived.  The trunk was awful--it was very bulbous/tuberous, and huge compared to the leaf portion.  Just ugly.  I called Brussel's directly and explained that I wasn't sure I had even received the same type of ficus I ordered.  They promised to call me back, but didn't.  I called Amazon, and they quickly placed an order for a replacement.  I e-mailed Brussel's to let them know to expect a replacement order, and explained about the first plant.  Didn't get a response, but the replacement plant was much the same.  The roots/trunk were less bulbous and more compatible with the overall size of the tree.  It wasn't quite as unattractive, but still didn't look like the same tree as displayed in the picture.
