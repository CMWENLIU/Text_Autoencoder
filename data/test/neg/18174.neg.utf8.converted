I would like to start by saying that I have never written a review about food before. But, I must, after "tasting" this Bar Harbor Manhattan Clam Chowder... It is by FAR the WORST soup I have ever tried...I know "manhattan style" is not supposed to be thick like New England, but that isn't the problem. The problem is that this "chowder" has NO TASTE to it whatsoever..!! I didn't think it was possible, and I don't know how they could possibly remove ALL taste from their soup...but they did. I tried adding salt, pepper, tabasco, just to try to pull some kind of flavor out of this. Didn't work....needless to say, unless you like eating a soup that tastes like steam and tin, i'd AVOID this one.
