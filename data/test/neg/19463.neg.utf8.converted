I ripped open one of the bags and popped a few pieces into my mouth, and was appalled at how they tasted. They were not what I remembered! I cracked open one of the pieces to find that the peanut inside had white spots on it, which may or may not have been mold. I looked for an expiration date and instead found a code: 2167CX. After some research I found that the first digit indicates the year of production. I was horrified. This candy was made in 2002! Steer clear of Farley's and Sathers candy on this site unless you like 9+ year old candy!
