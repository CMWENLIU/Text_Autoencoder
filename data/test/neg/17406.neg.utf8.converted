We just received our Bonito flakes today and it seems that it expired already (2003 production date). We got lots expired Eden products, including this one, from Amazon this month and they cannot be returned due to Amazon policy. The latest Eden promotions are to ship out the overstocks and to "clear" items that are remainder from past warehouse leftovers. We also found it to be true for the majority of Amazon grocery promotions EVERY MONTH, wherever there's a discount code to be entered. Beware of the sales practice before you order, especially if in large quantities and it they are not to be consumed immediately.
