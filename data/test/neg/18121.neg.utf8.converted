As a Native American who is from Seattle, I was excited to try this well-reviewed product. It is a great disappointment. There were about 3 ounces of liquid as part of the weight for which we paid so dearly. The flavor was watery and fishy with a faintly salty hint of smokiness. Did I receive a bad batch? Whatever shall we do with the additional unopened package? It was intended as a gift... Maybe I will give it to the cats for Christmas.
