Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.
