Hawaiian Punch has switched to using sucralose.<br /><br />I'm not talking about the "diet" version - I'm talking about the regular version. Some (but not all) of the high fructose corn syrup (which is worse than sugar) has been replaced with sucralose. The result is that the drink is less thick than it used to be, and there's also an aftertaste. I plan to finish what I just bought, but I'm not sure if I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />The switch a long time ago from sugar to HFCS was already bad enough, but the introduction of sucralose is far worse.
