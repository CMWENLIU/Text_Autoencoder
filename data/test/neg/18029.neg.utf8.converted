We purchased this product through Amazon and received it promptly on May 16, 2012.  When it arrived, we looked everywhere on the canisters to find the expiration date.  None was visible, so we thought perhaps the date was contained within the coding numbers on the bottom of the canisters, but the information was indecipherable to us.  We called Knorr Swiss directly for assistance.  We were told that KNORR SWISS DISCOUNTINUED THIS PRODUCT IN 2004, and since the maximum expiration date on these sauces is 2 years past the manufacture date, they were seriously expired, and we were told that under no circumstances should this product be used for food preparation.  We logged onto our Amazon account to return the product, but were told the product was not eligible for return.  We then contacted Amazon by phone and, as usual, they were extremely gracious and co-operative.  They confirmed that grocery items are not eligible for return, but immediately processed a full refund for the amount of the purchase to our credit card account.  Amazon assured me they would deal with the vendor on this issue, and I trust that they will.  In the meantime, be aware that this is not a safe food product.  The only reason I gave this even 1 star, is that the product review format will not allow for 0 stars.
