PROS: this product TASTES and FEELS like REAL peanut butter. I would pay double...if I could deal with the cons:<br /><br />CONS: Gas. Horrible, horrible gas. And not just me - everyone who I know who has tried it experienced mind-blowing flatulence within 36 hours. And not just "bad" gas - we're talking about the kind you wish you could summon when the cop leans into your window and says "license and registration?"<br /><br />I wish I could continue to use this product...but I can't even stand MYSELF the next day, and seriously, that's bad: everyone usually loves their own brand!
