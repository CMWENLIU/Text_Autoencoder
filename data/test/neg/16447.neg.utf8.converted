Well, Aerogrow is sending me another unit.  They have already taken the trouble to send me a replacement bowl which fixed the first problem and later, they sent a replacement pump which shut down the entire system.  I don't like contacting them and then getting replacements.  My aerogrow setup does not look like the flourishing results at the local kitchenwares store.  My consumer experience thus far has stank despite customer service's efforts to fix the problems.  Customer service has remained courteous and attentive.  They have mailed out parts promptly but does that buy them my silence?  Well, I can see how the positive reviews are true on this site so make up your mind after reading all of them.  Mine is just one experience. I lost money and I lost time and will start all over again once I receive the new unit.  If I had ordered through amazon, I would have just returned it for a money refund.  So if you want to try hydroponic growing as I did, then go ahead and buy this but I urge you to buy from amazon.  Good luck.<br /><br />Here were my issues that were all responded to by aerogrow's customer service:<br /><br />(1) I was misled that by ordering directly from aerogrow instead of Amazon at the cost of Amazon's free shipping, I would become a special customer and receive discounts on future purchases on seeds and more machines. But when I wrote to aerogrow about not receiving any membership packet, I was told that the additional purchases should be made at the time of the initial purchase (when I have no experience with the worthiness of the aerogrow product)<br /><br />(2) aerogrow had to send me a new bowl because when I received the product the red indicator light for low water level was already on and NEVER shut off.  Following the suggestions from the phone rep did not solve the problem at all. The new bowl fixed the problem.<br /><br />(3)  Then I realized that deep in the growing period a number of herbs were not growing at all and was told that I had received a bad pump and would have to install a new one that Aerogrow would be sending me and that I would have to start all over again from the beginning with another packet of herbs that would be included in the package.<br /><br />(4) I unplugged the aerogrow and installed the pump according to the BLURRY pictures on the instruction sheet and now the entire machine will not turn on.  Changing the pump is messy and not recommended. Don't throw away the attaching screw for the old pump because Aerogrow doesn't give you anything but the pump and the blurry instructions.<br /><br />The remaining survivors are going to die but that's okay because I have a brand new packet of seeds and in two months, I MIGHT have herbs, right?<br /><br />(5) I put the new plug in today and now the machine won't turn on at all.  HELP!<br /><br />This product just isn't reliable and it is priced too high to be this risky.<br /><br />(6) Aerogrow reps always maintained a friendly tone and polite demeanor in dealing with me. However, I still felt wronged. When the replacement never showed up after weeks, I emailed requesting a full refund, offering to ship the machine back to them so they could investigate the problem. They said that I could chuck the old machine, the new one was at the post office because of a wrong address and that they would credit my credit card. I have to check to see if they did. I don't want another aerogrow anyway.
