I don't often take the time to review a purchase, but I couldn't NOT share my incredible displeasure with this product. Perhaps it will spare someone else the agony of consuming these bars. The experience is most accurately likened to eating a salty, chalky Rice Krispy bar. Healthy, maybe, but tasty? Absolutely not.
