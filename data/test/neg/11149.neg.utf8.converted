The issues I have with this item have to do with the shipping.  I have not tasted the product yet, so cannot comment on taste.<br />The first order arrived with one jar compromised and green/white mold on the cardboard box and noticeably less sauce in one container.  The container was not cracked or broken, but somehow it leaked out.<br />Customer Service was helpful and sent a free replacement.  That just arrived today and that package was even worse!  Black, fuzzy mold was widespread on the cardboard box and container label.  This time I just asked for a refund - I'll not try a third time.  The sauce might taste lovely, but it doesn't seem to handle the shipping process very well.
