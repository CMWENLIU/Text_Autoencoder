I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes. Hardly a bumper crop. During the growth I had to clean out the pump which got clogged with roots (more on that latter). So I figured, ok, I had to disturb the root system when I had to clean out the pump, so perhaps that was the problem.<br /><br />I started a second crop of Cherry Tomatoes about three months ago. So far, I have had one marble sized yellow tomato. I also have an additional two, marble sized, yellow tomatoes ripening. I have not even seen any flowers on the two red tomato plants. The red tomato plants grow, but no tomato production.<br /><br />I am running out of plant nutrients. I checked AeroGrows site, and they want a ridiculous price for an additional package of plant nutrients. Corporate greed at its worse.<br /><br />I have read all of the reviews, and I see that about one-third of the Cherry tomato reviews are positive. That leaves two-thirds of Cherry Tomato reviews as negative. Adding my negative Cherry Tomato review drops the positive Cherry tomato reviews to 30% positive, 70% negative.<br /><br />Given that we are all growing these things under pretty well controlled conditions, I suggest that the Cherry tomato seed kits might have a limited shelf life, and AeroGrow could be selling their old kits.<br /><br />My negative review of AeroGrow's cherry Tomato seed kit on their site was NOT PUBLISHED. So I published my review on Amazon.<br /><br />With respect to the AeroGrow garden, in my opinion, the location of the pump is flawed. It should not be located at the bottom of the tank because that is where the roots want to go. The pump should be located higher up on the tank, and it should be located in a position where it can be easily maintained, without damaging your crops. I hope someone else comes out with a competitive product. Frankly, I don't like the way AeroGrow does business.
