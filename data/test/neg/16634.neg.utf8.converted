Just today received a case (24 6 oz. cans) of Natural Balance Venison & Green Pea cat food. The cans wouldn't stack properly in the cupboard. On closer examination, we realized the tops of the cans were puffed up. The cat food is rotten. The carton said good till March 18, 2015. If you buy this food, take a close look at the tops so you don't use the food & make your cats deathly ill.
