The bag I received contained 8 oz. of tea, not the advertised 16 oz.  This is the reason it now sells for $24 when it used to sell for $48.  The manufacturer's label on the bag said it held one pound, but the bag was not physically large enough to accommodate that much tea.  Amazon gave me the option to accept half of my money back, which I went for.<br /><br />I might also note that the glossy-finish bag appeared to have been well worn.  It looked like it had been reused many times.<br /><br />Regarding the stems that another reviewer mentioned, over the years I have purchased Pearl Jasmine from three other suppliers (Numi, TeaSpring, SeattleTeaCup.com).  All of them looked like this.  With Davidson's product I actually noticed much shorter stems attached to the leaves than with other Jasmine teas, and the leaves were larger.  I also noticed that the pearls are slightly smaller than what I have purchased from other suppliers.<br /><br />The aroma from the open bag was pleasant and similar to what I have experienced with other suppliers' products.  The taste is another matter.  I brewed a cup and found a bitter taste not observed with any of the other brands.  Tea from other suppliers has always offered a pleasant aroma and taste that makes Pearl Jasmine worth the extra cost.  These are sadly lacking in Davidson's product.  I do not recommend it.
