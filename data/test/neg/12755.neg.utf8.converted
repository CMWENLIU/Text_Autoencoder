This has been my favorite tea for at least fifteen years. It was the best tea I'd ever had - naturally sweet, pungent with gingery spice, unbelievably fragrant and satisfying. I recommended it to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />I am currently drinking my first cup of tea from the last box of Good Earth "Original" Sweet & Spicy Tea I currently plan to buy. The badge says "New look! same great taste!" but only the first claim is true. Once all-natural (see above description), the second ingredient is now "artificial flavor," and it shows. This tea is bland, only a hint of its previous sweetness, virtually no spicy ginger punch. Whatever you have done, Good Earth, it was a mistake. I cannot recommend this new tea to anyone.
