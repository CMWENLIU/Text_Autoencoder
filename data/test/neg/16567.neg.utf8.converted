I was excited when I ordered this yesterday and it was to be delivered today. I had almost everything I needed for the next phase in my diet, but the almond meal flour. After reading reviews and the ingredients I went ahead and ordered. I came home for the delivery only to find that ants were all in the box it was shipped in. Needless to say I was even more disgusted when I discovered the seam on the side of the bag was open and had not been sealed correctly and that the ants were all in the bag crawling around! The box was not left outside so no, it was not sitting waiting on me to get it. I immediately got online and had to initiate a return. If you do decide to order from this company, open the box outside and check the bag for bugs. I will not be ordering from them again. I will try to post an image later to show what I meant about the ants. I had to take the bag and put it in large ziplock gallon bags (two facing each other) and put it into the freezer until I can put it back in the box, seal it, and return to sender. I order a lot off amazon and this is the first thing I have ever had come to me with this problem. The ants may have come from an Amazon warehouse, or FedEx, but the poor quality control on the bag was from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted amazon through the chat and informed them about my concern about sending a bag with insects back to them. I also shared I had posted images on this product page. They said I could discard it and they would process my refund. I do say that I am and have always been happy with the fact Amazon backs up the products they ship and aim for good customer service. I am not going to increase the rating because the ants wouldn't have gotten in the bag or probably been there if it wasn't torn and sealed properly at the manufacturer level.
