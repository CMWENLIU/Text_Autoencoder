I'd like to start off by saying I love Slim Jims and particularly the spicy varieties. I don't know what happened here, these were definitely not what I'm used to from Slim Jims. First there was no "snap" as you bite into the casing. Instead it was very mushy and I routinely squished the slim jim before I even could get them out of the wrapper. And probably worse still it just didn't taste very good. I didn't find it particularly spicey at all. Not even in the lots of spices, but not burn your mouth, kind of way. And the flavor was just not there. It didn't taste bad, but I would have much prefered regular Slim Jims to these supposedly Jerk flavored sticks.
