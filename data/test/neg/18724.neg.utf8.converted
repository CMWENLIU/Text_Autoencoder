beware  - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissa<br /><br />Not what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.<br /><br />Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil. Fantastic stuff.<br /><br />I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific.
