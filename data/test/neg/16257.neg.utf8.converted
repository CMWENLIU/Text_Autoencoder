Like another reviewer, we only have home-made bread in our house and have not bought a loaf of bread in 30 years. So, I am an experienced bread maker.<br />My first loaf of bread, made with a favorite recipe failed. While it did rise, the texture was similar to a "quick" bread made with baking powder. (I use my KitchenAid to kneed for about 8 minutes, then do a final 5 or 6 minute hand kneed to check for "feel" of the dough.) We made two sandwiches from it, then fed the rest to the goats.<br />I went to the Great River Organic Milling web-site to look at their recipes and made one using my KitchenAid rather than a bread machine. Once again, the texture was unacceptable. Finally, I made a honey/butter french bread from a recipe we have been using for years. While the dough rose during the pre-shaping rise, after shaping it went to sleep. When it was finally double in bulk I baked it -- and once again -- good taste, but quick bread texture.<br />An other reviewer has had similar problems.<br />So, what to do with the 20 pound of flour you have left? I have found that the flour makes great crackers --olive oil, flour water and what ever seasonings and flavors you want. (My recipe comes from Fine Cooking, but there are many on the web.) The Great River Bread flour can also be used in several of the recipes in "Simply Great Breads<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600852971">Simply Great Breads: Sweet and Savory Yeasted Treats from America's Premier Artisan Baker</a>It works in the crescent rolls (pg 58) and in the flatbreads beginning on page 75.<br />I hope this comment helps other like me that have a great deal of bread flour that they do not wish to use in "regular" bread. I'm down to 15 pounds left to go!
