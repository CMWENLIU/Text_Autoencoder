This is one of the few times that Amazon has really let me down.  According to the company that sold this item -- Nutricity is the name of the company -- Amazon mispublished the price of the item.  I was supposed to get 60 of the Numi pots for the price they advertised, but I only got 10, because according to the company that these pots came from, Amazon made a mistake.  No one called me to correct the mistake, but it was corrected on Amazon when I back on-line to see what had happened.  I kept a copy of the advertised price that I bought the pots for.  I am terribly disappointed that I was not contacted by Amazon and told of the mistake.  So, instead of 60 pots for $265+, I got stuck with 10 pots.  I called the manufacturer and asked to return the pots with them paying the postage for the mistake.  The rep at Nutricity said she'd get back to me.  I never heard from here again.
