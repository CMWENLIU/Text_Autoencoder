Be aware that the image shown is not the true product you will receive. The product I received is the new blend "from the makers of Maxwell House". The new blend tastes a lot differently from the original blend. I ordered the product from Amazon.com because it gave the impression they had the original blend. I would not have ordered it if I had known otherwise....and it is a non-returnable product. I feel this is very misleading and unfair.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WQA">General Foods International Coffee, French Vanilla Cafe Coffee Drink Mix, 9-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a>
