If you like your chocolate dark, rich, melt-in-your-mouth and creamy, this is not your bar. The texture was too solid, not at all melty, zero creaminess, and the chocolate itself had an odd off flavor that took me a while to figure out - it was acidic, very much so. This is chocolate in its most natural, healthy, and sadly, least tasty form.  If you are eating this for health purposes, it's the right one, but there are a thousand better tasting chocolates out there.  It's a shame since I really wanted to like this, but those European confectioners that have been tweaking chocolate for the last couple of hundred years, they knew what they were doing.
