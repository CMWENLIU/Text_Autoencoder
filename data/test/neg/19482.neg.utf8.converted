My family recently adopted a 15 lb. Chihuahua mix who was found abandoned... we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand, but I'm guessing it wasn't anything high-quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat.  My goal was to get her on a high-quality diet (a "6/6" rating), and researched high protein/grain free diets and the benefits of them.  Additionally, I read up on Innova/Evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality, and someone else on a forum recommended we try the Red Meat Small Bite kibble with her.<br /><br />Even at first sniff, my dog indicated she didn't like it.  Of course, I figure it would take some time, so I worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on.  It basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the Innova Evo when it was mixed in with some wet food, and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in.<br /><br />Shortly after being on this high-protein diet (we didn't even finish her small bag of food), she began to urinate around the house, which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her.  It turns out she had urinary crystals, which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet.  We had to put her on Flagil, and the vet recommended I put her on Hill's Science Diet c/d (which I know is full of corn and grain fillers).  After politely declining, I changed her diet to something more holistic that DOES have grain (a "4/6" rating).  She's fine now...<br /><br />Innova/Evo is an extremely high quality brand... perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs.  I know not ALL dogs may have this reaction to a high-protein diet, but I really think people need to understand that high-protein/no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health.  In our case, it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch.
