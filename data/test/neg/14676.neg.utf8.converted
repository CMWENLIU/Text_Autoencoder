I bought these based on the nutritional information thinking they'd be like high-protein wasabi peas. I ignored the other reviewer's comment that the wasabi was unevenly distributed. Big mistake.<br /><br />The texture is pretty substandard compared to wasabi peas--they're a little bit cardboardy and they make my mouth feel dry. They also taste under-salted to me. But most of all, the unevenly distributed wasabi flavor means that one handful will taste like paper and the next will make you cry.<br /><br />I really wanted to like them. :(
