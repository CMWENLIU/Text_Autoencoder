Not a fan.  There's really nothing good about these.  They only taste a little bit like blueberry, but what really gets me is that they are more like crackers.  I saw "newtons" and I assumed they would be soft and cake-like.  But no, they are hard and crunchy like crackers - and they kind of taste like cardboard.  Imagine eating Wheat Thins without any flavor at all (even the plain ones have some sort of spices on them) - that's what these remind me of.  My toddler also hated them, and so did my pregnant wife.  My dogs liked 'em, though!
