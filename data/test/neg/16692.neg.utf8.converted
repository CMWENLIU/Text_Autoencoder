I work for Heinz and bought this as a funny item to add to a gift bag for a co-worker; however, the packaging pictured here is not the same as what I received.  Pictured here, the name stands out and has a funny impact; the cans I received were slightly re-worded so the phrase "spotted dick" was lost in the middle of the phrase "Taste of Home Delightful Spotted Dick Pudding" with all words having the same size and style of font.  It's almost as if they deliberately wanted to remove the perhaps unintentional shock value the original packaging had.  Sadly, that's why I purchased it!
