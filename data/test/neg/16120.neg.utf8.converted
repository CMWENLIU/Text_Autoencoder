The seeds looked and smelled perfectly fine at first when they were whole seeds, but as soon as i ground them, i realized they were spoiled. They instantly had a sour smell to them once ground, almost like spoiled milk. I have eaten brown flax seeds many times before and never smelled anything like that on them. Maybe these golden seeds smell bad, but i read that they should taste and smell even better.<br /><br />What bothers me most is not only that i have to throw them all out, but also that they take at least a year to spoil when whole which means amazon likely had them sitting around for that long in a warehouse and still sold them to me anyway.
