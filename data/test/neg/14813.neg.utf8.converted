I was very disappointed : this tea doesn't smell anything. The green tea doesn't have any flavor. I tried to roast some brown rice to add some taste : I could not taste the green tea, it's like haystack. Amazon was very nice, they sent me another 2 bags, but with the same result : No taste at all ! I don't recommand this product.
