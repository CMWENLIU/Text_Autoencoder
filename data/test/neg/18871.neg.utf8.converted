THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS IT APPEARS! THE BOTTLE IS TINY, BUT LOOKS LIKE A STANDARD 32oz BOTTLE, IN THE PICTURE! If you fall for the picture, as I did, without paying attention to the fluid oz. size, then you end up paying 30 dollars for a 32oz. bottle, which normally sells for under 20 dollars. Legal but very deceptive....BOYCOTT these Charlatans!
