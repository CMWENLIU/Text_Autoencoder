I'm not an expert on Basmati rice, but this brand has no aroma and turns to mush if cooked for too long in too much water.  It has very little taste, and is certainly not buttery tasting.  It comes with absolutely NO cooking instructions.<br /><br />Mixed half and half with wild rice, and properly cooked, it is palatable, but if you were expecting aromatic, buttery Indian Basmati, you're likely to be disappointed.  Otherwise, it's relatively inexpensive, and is a good substitute for "regular" white rice.
