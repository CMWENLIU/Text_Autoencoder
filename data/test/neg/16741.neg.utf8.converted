The listing didn't list any other ingredients, so I thought I was buying asafoetida.  As it turns out, it is a compounded substance that lists asafoetida after rice flour and gum arabic and before turmeric and wheat flour.  Not only was this a surprise because I had no idea that there were fillers, but I have celiac disease, so the stuff is actually toxic for me.
