THE MUSHROOMS ARE HUGE, AND DO COME IN A LARGE JAR, BUT MINE WAS ONLY 2/3 FULL.<br /><br />TO USE, TAKE OUT 1 OR 2 MUSHROOMS, SLICE THEM TO SIZE WANTED (REMEMBERING THEY WILL SWELL UP) AND REHYDRATE THEM IN COLD WATER.<br /><br />THEY ARE AN ODDITY, AND HANDY, BUT QU9TE EXPENSIVE, AS COMPARED TO THE CANS OF SLICED MUSHROOMS.
