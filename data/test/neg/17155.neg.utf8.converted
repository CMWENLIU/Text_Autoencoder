Edited my review to reflect that this is a different prodct.<br /><br />5 React Gum is amazing, the best ever.<br /><br />However this is not that, this is React 2 gum which is awful. I ordered 2 boxes and got the wrong product but didn't notice until well after my return period had passed (I keep them in bulk since that had become hard to find). Take the original React gum, fruity, fantastic tasting and then put a big pile of really strong mint in it... Awful. Fruity + Mint doesn't work, at least not here. I hate every other 5 gum I've tried except the original 5 React so it's very disappointing they'd change it the way they did.
