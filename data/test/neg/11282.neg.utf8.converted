This is an unusual product. It does work but it needs to be dissolved separately and with heat before addition to what you are making. I tried to make Marshmallow root marshmallows with it and it did not work. This product however will stiffen up gelatin marshmallows so it does work. I cannot say this product is very useful as very few recipes ever call for it but it is cool conversation piece. Also, it might be a good product to rescue your emulsion that you are making if the chemistry is right but you will have to discover that for yourself. Just be careful of lumps when using this product, dissolver thoroughly before adding.
