I used to buy pistachios from The Nut Guys but they went out of business, so I decided to try these, in spite of the fact that there are really expensive, especially once you add the shipping. Unfortunately, these were not nearly as good. The taste was so-so, and the freshness was sub par. I hate to leave a bad review for a product made by a US farmer, I really do. But at this price, I feel like it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />To be fair, I bought these in the winter, so maybe that explains the lack of freshness? But if that's the case, I might as well buy the cheap nuts at my local Costco. Very disappointed.
