I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$
