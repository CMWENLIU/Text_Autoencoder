Yes, these are delicious.<br /><br />But when I got them, they showed up in an extremely battered envelope -so much so that the envelope was hanging open in two places- and inside, the almonds weren't packed with any sort of label, identifier, sticker, ANYTHING. Just a plain, unmarked sandwich baggie.<br /><br />One of the other people who reviewed this item complained that the seller didn't state that the product contained milk fat, so was the seller's solution to stop including nutritional information at all?  Can they do that? The almonds I received didn't list nutritional info, ingredients, allergy information, weight, serving size, or anything else that the FDA has standards for.  Not even a label that says what they are.<br /><br />Also, since the almonds arrived in such a piece of crap envelope with no packing material, a lot of them arrived broken.<br /><br />And since I ordered these as a gift, I feel reeeally weird about presenting someone with an unmarked baggie of broken brown things.
