I YELL AT PEOPLE ALL THE TIME THAT TALK/COMPLAIN ABOUT PACKAGING ETC BECAUSE THERE'S A;WAYS A SEPARATE PLACE FOR YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT...BUT IN THIS CASE I WASNT GIVEN THE OPTION<br />I WAS GOING TO GIVE 2 1/2 STARS TO SPLIT IT UP WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE PROBLEM BUT IT WOULDN'T ALLOW ME<br />WELL MY 2 BEAGLES LOVE IT...AND ONE IS VERY PICKY..I CAN NOT USE AS A "MEAL" BECAUSE THE AMOUNT IN THE BAG WOULD LAST A PUPPY 2 WEEKS IF EVEN...MY 3 YRS OLD IT SAYS FEEDS 2 CUPS A DAY? THAT WOULD LAST 2 DAYS....FOR MY 1 YR OLD SAYS 1- 1/2 CUPS A DAY SO MAYBE 3-4 DAYS FOR HER...DO YOU FEEL OVER 20 BUCKS A BAG ITS WORTH IT? NOT FOR ME...I USE IT STRICKLY AS TREATS. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION...IS THE BAG IS...HUGE....BUT LITERALLY 1/4 FULL (LIKE THOSE BAG OF CHIPS YA BUY) MAKES YOU THINK YOUR GETTING A LOT WHEN IN REALITY YOUR NOT...AND NOW FOR THE WORST PART..<br />ITS "SUPPOSE" TO BE CUBES OF FOOD..HA! MY LAST 2 BAGS WAS 1/4 BAG CUBES 3/4 DUST!!! YOU CAN LITERALLY JUST SCOOP IT UP WITH A CUP OR SPOON! SO ALL THATS GOOD FOR IS...SHAKING ON TOP OF OTHER FOOD!!<br />I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS EVER AGAIN!<br />NOT RECOMMENDED!
