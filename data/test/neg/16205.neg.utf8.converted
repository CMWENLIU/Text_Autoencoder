This Taco Bell sauce misses the mark. I gave a very positive review for the other two flavors of Taco Bell sauce, but this one is no good. It is almost like they are trying to get a cheesy nacho taste in this, but it comes off like fake cheese flavor. Really very unappealing, and I suggest you not waste your time/money on this one. The Chipotle and the Jalapeno sauces are wonderful, but this one is a loser.
