I normally don't write reviews, but I wanted to spare others from tasting this chocolate. I was looking for an alternative to the Dr.'s chocolate (sweetened with xylitol), and so I ordered this product. Once I opened it, I ate two small squares of the bar. From the first taste, it was ok. It was the aftertaste that had me on the couch trying not to vomit, that prompted this review. It's taken about two hours, a few apples, and some melba toast to re-settle my stomach. You'd have to be pretty desperate to eat this nasty chocolate. I think you'd be better off just eating unsweetened bitter chocolate than any chocolate sweeted with Stevia.
