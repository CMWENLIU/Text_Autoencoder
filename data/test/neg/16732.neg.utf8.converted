Repeat. This is NOT Full-Leaf Tea. This is a canister of disc-shaped teabags of ground up tea. Rather disappointing when I opened it.<br /><br />However, the scent is wonderful, and the vanilla gives it a slight sweet taste. The almond flavor could be stronger, but really, I was just hoping for a better quality black based on the description. Disappointing order.
