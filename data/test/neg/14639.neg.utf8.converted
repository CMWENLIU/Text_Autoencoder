I have tried other Torani syrups, french vanilla, vanilla, vanilla bean, hazlenut...all of which I liked. This caramel syrup has a strong, chemically aftertaste and smell which can be somewhat diminished if you put it in REALLY strong coffee but even then lingers on very unpleasantly. Amazon was great they sent me out another 3-pack to see if it was just that batch.....Nope. It's definitely something off with this flavor. They refunded my money. I will continue to buy Torani, but not this caramel flavor.
