I had used Nutiva shelled hemp seed in 5 lb bags, and rather liked that product.  I thought this protien powder would be a good way to get the same benefit from a less expensive product.<br /><br />The flavor of this powder is not nearly as good as the hemp seeds, and the texture is way to fibrous.  I'm going back to the seeds.
