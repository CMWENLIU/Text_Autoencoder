I had purchased tamarind candy several years ago.  It was sweet tasting.  This product is salty and spicy. When I tried to get a refund from the company that I bought this from, I was only offered 50% of my money back.  This product has chili powder in it.<br /><br />I would not have bought it had I had known that.
