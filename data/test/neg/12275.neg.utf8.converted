Tried the gluten-free mix in apple muffins sweetened with applesauce and agave nectar.  Awful. Had to throw them out, but I figured it might have been the baking powder that lent this strange, bitter/sour aftertaste.  Then I tried it to make a roux for a chicken-broth-based cream sauce - and I had to throw that out too.  The aftertaste is highly unpleasant and I don't see how anyone gets past it.  I'm very happy with Bob's Gluten-Free Pancake Mix, so this was a surprise.
