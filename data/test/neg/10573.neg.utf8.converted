DISCOUNT???? Where is the discount here? I can get the 20 oz bottles for $1.29 in my local C-Town and sometimes they even have them for $.99 cents. Not even the larger sized bottles cost this much ($1.99). I am very disappointed in Amazon for selling this product at such a high price. Is it because it is the "Zero" type, because they have a 20 pack of regular vitamin water for $18.99. SMH
