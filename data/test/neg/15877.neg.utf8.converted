I really like hot chocolate all year round but find that drinking more than one cup is just not a good idea in hot weather.  I had to literally force myself to drink the entire cup. The white chocolate, as well as the regular chocolate, had a funky taste to it. At first I just thought I was something about the white chocolate, since I don't usually drink white chocolate, but then the next day I tried the regular and the same taste was there.  I have made tea and coffee in my brewer, and the taste wasn't there.  I have also made other kids of hot chocolate without the taste, so I would have to say that it is just in this particular product.  I unfortunately cannot send this product back due to my location, but I know I will never by anything by this company again.
