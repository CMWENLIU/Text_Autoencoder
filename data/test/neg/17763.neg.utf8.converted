I have had sticky toffee puddings in both Britain and the United States. This particular brand makes without a doubt the WORST I have ever had. In fact, it's not sticky toffee pudding. It's some kind of chemical mixture which is shaped into a food-like product. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
