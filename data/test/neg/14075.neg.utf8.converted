Ordinarily Wonka Giant Chewy SweeTarts are my favorite candy.  I was impressed by the fast shipping and delivery by Amazon.com but was immediately disappointed because the candy was stale.  I signed up for automatic reshipment but I might cancel because I don't know whether they'll send me the same stale product I received this time.  I'd rather pay higher prices and get fresh product from someone else.
