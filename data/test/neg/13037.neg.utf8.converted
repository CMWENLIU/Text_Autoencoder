The packaging is a major bear.  As others noted, you have to dump the bag into a container that is barely large enough to hold it.  Pretty much every time, I dump about a scoop onto the counter.  Also, because the lid is attached, it "swoops" down and actually blows some powder out every time you close it.  Our counter top is always a mess, so I finally just got a secondary tupperware container.<br /><br />Also, it may be a fluke, but when they switched to this new package, my son had trouble keeping the formula down.  He may have had a bug, but I'm guess the change upset his stomach.  Only a few more months of bottles, but if we have another little one, we will be using Similac.
