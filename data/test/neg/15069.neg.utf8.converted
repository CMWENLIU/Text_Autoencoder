Based on the reviews and the word 'Chai' on the container, I decided to try it...  I am disappointed...  The taste reminds me of the latte freeze you can buy at Costco... or the taste of the Starbuck's Bottled Frappachino's and powdered Nescafe latte.  Its really sugary and not at all spicy.  It has a fake non dairy milk taste to it...  If you are hoping for a taste similar to Oregon or Tazo Chai Concentrate... this is not the way to go...  I might drink it if I run out of Chai flavored tea bags or hot cocoa or palpable water... but I have a feeling it will be living on my kitchen shelf for a very long time...  I tried all the variations on how to prepare it, listed on the back of the container, and none of them inspired me to 'want' to drink the stuff...
