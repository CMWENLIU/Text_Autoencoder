This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food.
