I was so very disappointed when these dates came in. They were the worst dates I have ever had--hard as a rock.  I was shocked and in disbelief.  The dates came from Hadley, which I thought was a reputable company. I would think they would be ashamed to send out such a poor product. Boy, was I ever wrong.  I will NOT order these ever again. Please heed this review when ordering dates and buy them elsewhere.
