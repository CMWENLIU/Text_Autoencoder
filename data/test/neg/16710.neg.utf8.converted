This cube is the right shape, and dispenses treats wonderfully.  However, my wrestless herding dog, who is very smart, does not enjoy the difficulty in getting the hard plastic cube to "turn over" and give her a treat.  I'm disappointed because I hoped this toy would help some of her boredom during the day while I work. If the plastic were softer or there were more outlets that dispense treats she might go for it.  Otherwise I don't recommend this for at least the Sheltie breed.
