I purchased this model from my local Staples for $129 for my home. I brought it home and followed the 1st time Prime instructions. First of all when it turned on it was extremely loud! So loud you could hear it all over the house. It shook everything on the counter tops. I know it doesn't have "quiet brew" technology but does it have to sound like a fighter jet in my kitchen! To make matters worse NOTHING came out, not one drop of water. All I got out of the machine was loud noises. I'm extremely disappointed and have to return it to the store today. I'm not sure I even want a replacement because if that's how loud they really are, I think i'll pass. My roommate gets up at 5 am and if I get woken up by the house shaking due to him making coffee every morning, I'll end up throwing the the thing right out the front door.
