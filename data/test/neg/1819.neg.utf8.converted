OMG! definitely not what I expected!  The smell alone is enough to turn you off!  smells like really stinky fish!!!  I should of just bought one pack just to see what they are like!!  Instead I bought $60 worth!!! And I can't return them.  Stupid me should of read more closely!!  They taste like rubber. Even when I added them in a sauce - they were awful.  I just couldn't go thru with it.  Even my husband who eats sushi and other stuff I would never go near - said they were downright nasty!!  I started to gag!  But this is my opinion!  It's a miracle people eat these!
