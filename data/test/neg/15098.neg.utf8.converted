The full list of ingredients was not anywhere to be found so I mistakenly assumed the product was just plain dried organic cranberry and got excited about it. But it turned out that it was cranberry + sunflower oil + sugar. Everything is organic but - alas! - sugary. And there's waaay too much sugar in it, even soaking couldn't help at all. Very frustrating.<br />Cranberry is a rare berry that is low in oxalates, I'll be happy to buy it on regular basis, but they just spoiled it with sugar.
