Bought a couple jars of this just last night for a dinner party, thinking I was getting the product I was familiar with. What I was familiar with was a wonderful product, with a delightful "popping" texture, a strong, salty bite, and a lovely presentation.<br /><br />What I got, to my vast embarrassment and disgust, was a fetid, sweet taste and a runny, slightly greenish goo the color and texture of goose plop.<br /><br />I actually thought the stuff had maybe gone bad. Then I noticed the "ingredient list."<br /><br />Really? Lemon Juice? Xanthan Gum? What on earth are these ingredients doing in a jar of caviar?<br /><br />I know this stuff is not exactly high end, but come on! It was previously a very nice product!<br /><br />I was gonna toss it, but the hostess ended up giving it to her cat. Do not know if he ate it or not.<br /><br />Bitterly disappointed in this. Seriously, it's not edible. It's absolutely disgusting, both in looks and in taste.
