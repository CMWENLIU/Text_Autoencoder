I tried the salt and vinegar on micro popcorn and am now about to dump all six.It is disgusting,kinda like a matallic taste.I love salt and vinegar crisps/chips but this stuff is nothing like that.Also the expiration date is August,2 months time.You would need an army of people using it to get through it by then.Also the salt content is 145 mg per 1/4 teaspoon.They recommend you use one capful which I measured as 4 teaspoons so each serving is actually 145 X 16 = 2320 mg. Not good.
