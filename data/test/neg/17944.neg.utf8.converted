POISON "Chlorhexidine" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, "Chlorhexidine" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  "Chlorhexidine" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their "vet/doctor" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that "serious" problems may occur, especially if your dog "licks" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; "conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same "intellectual scientists" who've managed to put half our nation on "safe for you" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, "prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration," leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay."<br />Japan stopped using "Chlorhexidine" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats "grooming" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? "And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc.
