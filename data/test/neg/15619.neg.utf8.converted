The best price I've found.  I make english marmalades, jams and jellies, commercially for the farmer's market so really need to research prices so that I can continue to produce!!  Buying through Amazon really helps me save on this necessary, but otherwise expensive item.  Now I have confidence that I can continue to make my great product and earn a little spare cash and serve the local community !!  Saving on this item really helps.  Thank you, Pauline, "Morganics"
