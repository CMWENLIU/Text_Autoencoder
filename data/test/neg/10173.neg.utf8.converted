I was very dissappointed with Dukan Slimming Tea.  As a Dukan dieter one of the side effects can be constipation due to lack of fiber in the diet, I thought this would help move things along. As recommended, steeped 1 tea bag with 2 cups of boiling water for 2 minutes before I went to bed, I woke up numerous times through out the night with stomach pain and discomfort which continued the following day. It does do what it is suppose to do, but with a painful price to pay. I tried this on 2 different occasions with the same unfortunate result. I won't be purchasing this again.
