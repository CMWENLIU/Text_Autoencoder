I just received my order of Big Train Chai...and right after this review, I'll be walking both canisters to the neighborhood dump. This will teach me (again) not to purchase in bulk without trying a small sample first. I had chosen Big Train because of the wonderful reviews. So it was disappointing when I made my first cup and sipped a concoction that tasted like powdered milk with a dash of pumpkin seasoning. Very chalky...like cheap, instant cocoa mix. The blend of seasonings is more reminiscent of pumpkin pie than chai and has none of the peppery goodness that I enjoy so much. The one positive I will give is that it is a very fine grain and easily dissolves in hot water.
