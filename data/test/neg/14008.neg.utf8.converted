I was a big fan of these soft peppermint balls for at least 15 years or more.  I had them at home, at work and in my purse and in the car glove compartment.  However, I no longer purchase these candies.  They used to be made in the USA, in Georgia, just a few years ago I learned they are now made in MEXICO!  This information is on the back of the package in very small print.<br /><br />A little research revealed that Bobs company was taken over in 2005 by Farley's & Sathers Candy company.  Their web site shows at this time they have 2 plants in Mexico.<br /><br />I have major concerns about the quality of any food item made in Mexico and will not purchase any such food once I can identify the point of origin -- like Green Giant Brussels Sprouts are now grown and packed in Mexico.  For shame on the American companies and their greed for more profit at the expense of American consumers.<br /><br />The Good News is that there is still a wonderful soft peppermint ball made in the USA:  Red Bird Brand, made by the Piedmont Candy Co in Lexington, North Carolina.  Made in the USA since 1890!!  Reasonable priced and totally delicious.  "Nuff said"
