This is waaaay overpriced. I buy this same stuff from an online Asian grocer for less than six dollars for a bag almost this size. These are just bonito flakes--nothing different about them from regular ol' bonito flakes for Japanese cooking. Save your money and don't buy the kind branded especially for pets. I will say, the cats go nuts for this stuff.
