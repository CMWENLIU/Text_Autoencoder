Good price, not the greatest quality. Mint tea has a lot of volatile oils and loses them rapidly after harvesting and drying. My package was obviously exposed to the air either before or after packaging to the point that most of the mint is gone. Dissapointed, even cheaper mint bagged tea is packaged in airtight containers to retain it's flavor and essential oils. I hope Davidson's can improve on their quality control and packaging.
