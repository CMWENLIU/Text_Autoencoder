This is marketed as a whole grain gluten free cereal. Sounds healthy and yummy and hip, right? Wrong! It is corn (not organic!!!) + evaporated cane juice + some other thing in trace amounts. Might as well call rice crispies a whole grain cereal and an excellent source of iron. Taste was just ok, nothing special. Not buying it. Ever.
