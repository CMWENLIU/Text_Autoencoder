The new formula is horrible.  Gave me bad, BAD stomach issues the entire day after taking it.  So I tried it again just to make sure.  Yep, same thing.  Stevia is NOT natural, and should not be marketed as such.  If I wanted caffeine, I would have bought one of the 1000+ caffeinated supplements out there.  Very disappointed in both the manufacturer and in the seller for not pointing out the change in formula.
