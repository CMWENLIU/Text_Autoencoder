Don't bother buying this product.  The price is nice as a solution to buying breakfast everyday at work, but the cheap containers that kelloggs is using now suck.  5 out of the 60 boxes I received were damaged and food was all over the box it was shipped it.  The price was worth it with the discounts kelloggs offers sometimes but losing 8% of the amount paid for ruins the value.
