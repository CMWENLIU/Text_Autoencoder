The good news - the cookies are tasty and fresh. The bad news - the most current packaging (summer 2010) means the contents are powder by the time they reach you. In the past, Salem used a well-padded interior honeycomb packaging which protected the cookies. The newest packaging offers virtually no protection, and the cookies are mostly reduced to crumbs and powder.<br /><br />These cookies are very thin, paper-thin, and crisp. It's hard to eat just a few!
