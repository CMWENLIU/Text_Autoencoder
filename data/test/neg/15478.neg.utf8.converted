(Pack of 12) 20.4 oz. net</a><br />I purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences.  When I saw them on Amazon, I thought it would be a super savings.  However, these cookies must be fresh, or they are simply not worth eating.  The photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies.  When they were received in fresh condition, they were excellent, with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid, shiney dark brown.  In this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and  pale, discolored coating.  I ordered 3 seperate times, 1st box was "great"  other two were not even edible.  1 FOR 3 MAKES THEM A VERY POOR VALUE.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XOQZC">Nabisco Snack Wells Creme Sandwich Cookies 1.7 oz.
