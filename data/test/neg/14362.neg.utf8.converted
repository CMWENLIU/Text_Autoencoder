I purchased this honey believing the the Bio-Active 20+ rating was equal to a UMF registered rating.  After further research I realized I did not get what I thought I was ordering.  Guess that was my fault by not researching more than I did before ordering.  The taste is good and I will use it for other than medicinal purposes - but feel I paid way too much for what I received.  For those who don't know, the label must include the UMF
