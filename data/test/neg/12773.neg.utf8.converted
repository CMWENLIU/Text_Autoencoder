When Paul Newman was alive his big foodie project was salad dressing - and it was GOOD.<br /><br />Then his daughter got into the mix and decided to peddle foods that are on trend with certain diets (vegan, organic, gluten free, etc.) and the results are dismal.<br /><br />Overpriced small portions that aren't particularly good or even when not awful are not better than other brands. These cookies are NOT good.<br /><br />Small in size I couldn't help but notice how everyone in the bag was uniformly burnt on the bottom. Surprisingly flavorless for a gingersnap UNTIL you bite into the candied ginger. Then you have a sudden burst of flavor stuck like a gummy candy to your teeth while the rest of your mouth is trying to process a hard cookie. Not my favorite sensation. Normally I love to dip my gingersnaps in milk, unfortunately even this did not improve them for me. I did not finish the bag and will not be recommending them to anyone else.<br /><br />If you love Paul Newman & want to support his charities - stick with the salad dressing.<br /><br />If you want a great gingersnap that is awesome with milk - get Stauffer's!
