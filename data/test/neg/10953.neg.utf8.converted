One of the flavor memories of my 1960s childhood that evinces the least nostalgia is that of stale orange "tonic" (as we called it in New England) bought from the local Bradlees or Ferretti's discount super markets. The only more heinous flavor was grape soda -- a chemical brew so noxious that it burned going down (we thought this was normal) and left an acid-stripped sheen on the teeth.<br /><br />But now, this taste sensation is back, in the form of Izze's "all natural" sparkling juice. "All natural" is the sort of 21st century newspeak terms that hides more than it reveals. To my hippy-dippy mind, all natural means orange juice (even if from a concentrate) plus some pure spring water gently infused with natural CO2 and bottled by hand by pure, cotton sundressed nymphs. It does not have (as does this concoction) *fourteen* ingredients, including "natural flavor" (what, sulfuric acid?), glycerol ester of rosin, or pyridoxine hydrochloride, even if this is supposedly vitamin B12.<br /><br />I now have a case of this stuff in my house. Thanks for the memories, Amazon Vine!
