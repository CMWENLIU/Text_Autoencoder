I got the spices and they were old stale and full of bugs(pantry beetles). I had to throw the entire batch in the trash. I didn't bother to send it back pantry beetles are very hard to get out of the house and can easily invade your other spices. I am just glad I found them quickly and got rid of  this stuff.
