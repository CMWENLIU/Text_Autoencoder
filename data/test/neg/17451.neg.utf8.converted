They sure didn't last days, or even hours.  My lab and aussie shepherd each polished one off in about 5-10 minutes, depending on thickness.  Most of the ones in the package were very thin, so they just tore right through them.  I'll have to try the braided ones next time to see if they last longer.  The dogs do love them though.
