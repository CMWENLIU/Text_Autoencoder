I purchased this at a local chain grocery store (Albertsons) for $2.79.  Unfortunately, the tea tastes like grass and nothing nearly like jasmine green tea.  Maybe it's me, but there wasn't a good balance between the jasmine and green tea.  As FYI, each tea bag is individually packaged, but not sealed.  However, the main box is sealed.<br /><br />So far, the best jasmine green tea bags I've tried are ones from Bigelow.  And those tea bags are individually sealed.  I strongly recommend Bigelow over Touch Organic for good jasmine green tea in a convenient, stay-fresh packaging.
