If you had a real hot chocolate in Europe before tasting the rich aroma of cocoa beans and were lucky enough to try some of the ready made cocoa mixes from Switzerland or Germany (e.g. from companies like Hachez, Lindt, Movenpick) than this Double Chocolate product from Ghirardelli is a bitter disappointment. It is way too sweet (too much sugar) and has too little cocoa beans in it (to maximize profits). I am almost done with one of the 16oz tins and will not buy this product again nor can I recommend it. Too be quite frankly honest, it is not just Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix that is too sweet, it is pretty much impossible to find a good-quality-lower-in sugar-and-richer-in-cocoa hot cocoa mix in the States. And no, I am not willing to pay 12 bucks for a hot cocoa tin from Godiva, that is a rip off.
