These pops were absolutely awful. My first try was the German Chocolate Cake, which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy. The second try was the Cherry Cheesecake, which tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup. The third attempt was the Coconut Creme Pie, which had a mild coconut flavor.<br /><br />I gave up after the third attempt and shared a few of the remaining pops with some coworkers; most of them hated the pops as well, stating they tasted very artificial.<br /><br />I was very disappointed considering other products of this nature appear to have higher ratings.
