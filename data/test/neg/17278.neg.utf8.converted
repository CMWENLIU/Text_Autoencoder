I tried planting these indoors (after my cats decimated the nice crop I had!), but wasn't successful. It was winter, so maybe I overwatered or the sun wasn't quite right. There are so many seed though that I'll try again outside when the weather gets warm.<br /><br />I usually plant lots of seed and let them all sprout up without thinning. My cats come and munch on the little shoots and seem to like that, even curling up in the pot, although that was with different seeds. We'll see what happens with this!
