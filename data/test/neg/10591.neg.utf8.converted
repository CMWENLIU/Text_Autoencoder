howdy y'all,<br /><br />i bought this before the previous reviewer posted. [*sigh ...*]<br /><br />this is NOT bacon-y.<br /><br />the package front lists "with bacon bits", the ingredients list "bacon", the product name says "cheesy bacon macaroni" AND there are what appear to be bacon bits on the front-of-the-package product picture. all four claims appear to be flat out, tee-total, unmitigated _lies_.<br /><br />there are NO bacon bits in it. i searched the 2nd package after the 1st seemed so un-bacon-y. [*grin*] there is a vague, very faint scent of bacon in the cheese powder. there is NO bacon flavor to the finished product. i suspect there is a small amount of "powdered, bacon-like substance" in the package.<br /><br />the finished product is also a very low quality. i've had better mac-n-cheese with no-name microwave macaroni and cheese products.<br /><br />i bought an entire CASE of this "stuff" and the only way i can make myself eat it is by adding it to a [separately cooked] batch of this ...<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZ96">Kraft Easy Mac Dinner, Extreme Cheese, 12.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />the kraft easy mac is really quite good! [*grin*]<br /><br />take care,<br />lee
