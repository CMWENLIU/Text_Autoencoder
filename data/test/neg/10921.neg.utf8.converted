I once ordered FRS to try it. All I ordered was one simple box of product. Since then I have recieved shipments every month, which I never ever thought would happen. If I had known it was to be a regular monthly shipment, I would not have ordered the product to begin with. This is deceitful on their part. With companies like this, I feel I have to run their ordering process by my attorney before I order. If you are gonna order, be careful as you may get far more than you expected or would like, with your knowledge or approval. Very disatisfied customer.
