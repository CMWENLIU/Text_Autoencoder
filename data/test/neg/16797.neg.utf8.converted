I initially started my dog off on these as the gummy version was too easy for her to tear apart.  A few months later during my vet visit, she noticed my dog had two slab fractures on her molars.  Granted, my dog would tear into these, but now she has ruined her teeth and may require a root canal.  I now use kongs with treats that I replace once they start to look worn.
