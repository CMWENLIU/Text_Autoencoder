I tried to drink this a few different ways, even with half the mix.  And it was MUCH too acidic. Yes, I do have acid reflux problems.  But I have no problems drinking things like Vitamin Water and Gatorade.  I couldn't handle this drink.<br /><br />On the flip side, I did feel pretty good after drinking this.  I think the energy part works.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend you stay away from the powdered version if you don't have an iron stomach.<br /><br />I haven't tried the concentrate or the regular drink that comes in cans.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Tried out the Low-Cal Wild Berry that comes in the can and it wasn't too acidic.  Don't know what the deal is with the powder.
