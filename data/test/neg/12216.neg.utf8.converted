I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla. There is absolutely no vanilla aroma when I added it to my custards, even with additional amount. Sure, the vanilla specks are there, but what good would they do if they give nothing to the flavor of the dish? I must have gotten a bad bottle or something (is that even possible, for vanilla bean paste to go bad?). I'm quite disappointed, looks like I'll just have to stick with Costco vanilla extract from now on.
