The Goji is no doubt a 'superfood' and I've been having them for a long time and so may have become a goji connoisseur. The last time i bought these from Navitas and they just weren't good. They didn't taste good, very dry and worst of all they had a lot of fungus/yeast growing in them. Usually all dried fruit will have some yeast on them but these had just a lot of it, to the point that it made me sick despite of throwing away the ones that had turned black due to it.<br />I gave a bag to my boss since i wanted him to try the goji, which he had previously liked, but had to take it back from him for the reason.<br />Navitas is perhaps a good company and gojis are not made in a factory, but so is a lot of other packaged food and the seller needs to QC the product they sell.<br />Long live the Goji!
