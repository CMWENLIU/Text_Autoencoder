Decided to try these the other day and regretted it. These are hard to bite, very stiff and dry, and did not taste like peanut butter and chocolate, tasted synthetic somehow. One of the worst GF products I have found to date. GF does not have to taste horrible and shouldn't! Will stick to Envirokids rice bars from now on they are much better.
