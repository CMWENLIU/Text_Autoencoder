The description on this item says it's 3 years old and 9 inches tall...the one that arrived is 5.5 inches at it's highest point (including the container). The tree itself is just under 3 inches tall. It is a pretty tree but not at all as described. I would return it except that I don't have time to get another in time for Christmas but I am very disappointed.
