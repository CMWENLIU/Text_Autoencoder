From the other reviews, sounds like the cheese is really really good. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to find out. When I accepted the package from the FedEx driver, I immediately ran to the kitchen with excitement. That quickly turned to dismay when I opened the box, unsealed the thermal pouch, and discovered a *very* warm brick of cheese.<br /><br />The principles of foil insulation are to ward off conduction, convection and radiation. Used properly, they work quite well. But Amazon killed the entire thermal benefits of the pouch by wrapping both the cheese and the cold packs in heavy bubble wrap before placing into the thermal pouch. Additionally, due to the lack of moisture in the bubble trap they created, I don't think the ice packs were properly frozen to begin with.<br /><br />Hugely disappointing. Amazon, please teach your shipping personnel the proper use of insulated foil pouches. If this practice isn't corrected, I don't think this cheese can ever be successfully (i.e. safely) shipped.
