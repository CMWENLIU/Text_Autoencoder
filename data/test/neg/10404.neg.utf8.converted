I found these cookies to be very dense and difficult to bite through. There are nowhere near enough chocolate chips -- many of the cookies in my bag didn't have a single chip in them.<br /><br />Regarding the "organic" advertising: the ingredient list does not say that the chocolate chips used are organic and they contain soy lecithin. Since products that are not advertised as "100% Organic" and do not carry the "USDA Organic" seal may contain up to 30% non-organic ingredients it is very likely that these cookies contain lecithin from GMO soy because the label does not specify that the soy source used is organic or non-GMO.
