I thought something was a little odd about this company's marketing strategy.  No savvy business would think to advertise a California wine as a Hawaii wine.  So why did they choose Santorini, a popular tourist destination not known for its olive oil, to advertise an olive oil originating from the most prestigious olive growing region in the world, Messinia, home of the famed Kalamata olive?  Buyer gullibility?  Ignorance?  To drive this point home, Messinia is to olive oil what Bordeaux is to wine.  So this advertising gimmick was a real head scratcher...until I tried it.  Then it all made sense.<br /><br />To be fair, I'm a descendant of this region of Greece, so I had high hopes of procuring a top quality olive oil, especially given the price.  Instead, this olive oil was little different from the lower quality varieties sold by large food companies.  It is very light, an attribute on its own....if that were enough.  But it isn't, and there was a noticeable lack of aroma and flavor typical of olive oils from this region of Greece.  In fact, it was downright funky.  Maybe the large plastic jug it was shipped in was the culprit.  Olive oil from Messinia is traditionally packed in large cans.  So who knows?  All in all, this is not a terrible olive oil; it's just a very average, overpriced one.  There are several better Kalamata olive oils sold in local supermarkets (Iliada, to name one).  Consequently, I wouldn't recommend this oil to those that know the difference.
