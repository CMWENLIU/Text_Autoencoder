This green tea is decent, however, every single tea bag is in its own plastic pouch.  Further, the tea bags themselves are nylon, which they claim enhances the tea somehow.  All of this non-bio-degradable packaging is unnecessary, so you end up tossing everything in the trash can rather than the compost bin.  Next time I'm trying Harney and Sons Japanese Sencha, which I hear is pretty good with a much smaller carbon footprint.
