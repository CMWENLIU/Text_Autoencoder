Wow, wasn't expecting this! The noodles and rice products were like slippery little worms and fish eggs respectively. The only product I related it to is the noodles used in a Hawaiian soup called "Long Noodle". They were slippery and unmanageable like the noodles in this pack. Now I used to eat that soup quite often so my appetite is much more expansive than my wife who needs this product for diabetic alternatives. She gave them away immediately!
