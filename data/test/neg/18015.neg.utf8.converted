I had some kale chips at a friend's house that were amazing, so I felt adventurous and thought I would try these.  Big mistake.  These are absolutely inedible.  Not only do they not taste like barbecue, they don't taste like anything anyone should eat - ever.  I have to believe they never did a R&D/taste test phase for this product.  My quest to find delicious store-bought kale chips continues, but I know I will NOT be buying from Kaia again.  Bleeccch!
