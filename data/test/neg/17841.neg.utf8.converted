I bought this coffee after falling in love with Dunkin Donuts and 7-11 blueberry coffee. This unfortunately was not it. Not only is the flavor of blueberries not present, this coffee has an odd smell to it. The pods are small and will be too small for even single brew coffee makers. I have a 4 cup brewer and a single cup brewer. I tried it on both. No bueno. One pod was too little and the coffee was watery and not good. So I tried two pods. Still no blueberry coffee. The coffee was very very watery and although the box was supposed to be a medium roast it falls well short of that. This is a colossal waste of money even if you do get three boxes. I wish I could find someone to just take it off my hands.<br /><br />Flavor: no blueberry flavor whatsoever<br />Taste: coffee was very watery even with 2 pods and 8 oz of water.  I actually measured to be sure<br />Value: none<br /><br />Now, it's possible that I got a defective batch (maybe they forgot the blueberry?). Maybe I should return it and try again. But I just don't have energy for that.
