This was one of the worst soups I've tasted. I gave the rest of the carton away and hope someone likes it. It was watery, the dumplings were lumps of flour and tasteless. The veggies and chicken were minimal. What a disappointment. I like most of Campbells soups and this was a huge disappointment. Now I know why it was only $7+a carton.
