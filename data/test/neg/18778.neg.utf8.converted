Special K protein plus recently changed up their ingredients.  It states it is better tasting; however, it now has 7 grams of sugar.  I don't see how protein plus is any different from any other special K cereal, other than the 10 grams of protein.  The whole point of getting the protein plus cereal is to get a protein boost without the added carbs.  This cereal now has an addition 20 calories and 5 grams of sugar, and to be quite honest tastes worse than the original.  I don't care for overly sweet cereals.  I prefered the whole grain taste of the original special K protein plus.  It now tastes like a box of Tony's Frosted Flakes.  Yuk!
