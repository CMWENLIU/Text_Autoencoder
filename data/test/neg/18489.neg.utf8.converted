I was really excited to try this mix after the great reviews and having had really good hot chocolate in France. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed about how much sugar is in it. The sweetness just overpowers the chocolate and vanilla flavors. In my opinion, the overall flavor is just slightly better than the Carnation instant hot cocoa you can buy at your neighborhood supermarket. If there was less sugar, it would probably be pretty good. This is Americanized hot chocolate, not the type of rich hot cocoa goodness I had in France.
