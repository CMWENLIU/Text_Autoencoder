I also got two packs of 24 using the buy one get one free deal.  Despite the fact that the cookies are sealed in each individual box, the cookies are soft.  I've had Barnum's Animal Crackers countless times in my life, and I have never had soft cookies.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with over 40 small boxes of soft animal crackers.  Amazon says that this item isn't eligible for return.  I'm not giving the animal crackers a poor rating; I'm giving Amazon's animal crackers a poor rating.<br /><br />Don't buy these from Amazon!!
