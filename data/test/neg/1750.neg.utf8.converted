What a mess.<br /><br />These were not packed well.  No buffers.<br /><br />Just bags tossed into a box.<br /><br />Of the thirty bags.. SEVEN were busted open.<br />And when we opened the box.. we had a super STICKY mess on our hands.<br /><br />Waiting to hear from Amazon regarding this.<br /><br />Nearly 1/3 of the food items were ruined/contaminated.<br /><br />Buyer Beware!
