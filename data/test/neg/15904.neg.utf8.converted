Don't know how I missed that it was only 6 cups. I was in a hurry and I kept getting all the way to check out only to find the variety pack I wanted was "No Longer Available." So this came up, and I thought it was equivalent.  I know I should have read carefully, but everything else for this price was at least a 12-pack.<br /><br />And to top it off, one of them was TEA, which I don't drink, and another was Hot Chocolate, and another DECAF!  So I just paid $4.60 apiece for 3 cups.  I'm calling foul on this.
