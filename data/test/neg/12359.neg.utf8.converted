I ordered Auricchio Imported Provlone (1 lb including shipping $20.00). I was concerned about the excessive heat and immediately sent an email to the seller questioning the shipping mehtod used.  The seller never responded to my email.  The cheese arrived wrapped in paper and had the consistancy of Swiss Cheese not hard as an Imported Provolone should be.<br />I called the seller to complain thinking I did not receive Provolone Cheese. The seller insisted it was Provolone and not Swiss Cheese, He was not very empathic to my concerns. He told me to put the cheese in the refrigerator to harden. The cheese was comprised. It was provolone as stated, however, I would think the seller would know that an item like that should have been shipped over night or at least with dry ice. If he had responded to me and addressed my concerns perhaps the item could have been shipped properly.  I would not order from this seller again. He did give me an option to return the item at my expense. I decided rather then spend another $6.00 S&H (total for 1 lb chesse not eaten $26.00) it was more cost effective just to throw it out. I now hesitate ordering cheese online especially in the summertime.
