We make @5 purchases a month from Amazon, and this is by far the lowest quality product we've ever purchased.  Unfortunately, there weren't any reviews posted the day we purchased.  I hope others won't make the same mistake we did.  We love Amazon, but the return policy on products like this is really disappointing.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon would even carry this.  As other reviews have said, this is, at best, instant coffee in a K-cup.  It sounds like an infant rattle when you pick it up.  Our first cup came out like water that was slightly discolored.
