I read the earlier reviews about the red top coming off and spraying in face, but, since Ortho, decided to risk it as an anomaly.<br /><br />However, on the second bottle the hose connection came off several times (tried to reattach it).<br /><br />Ortho definitely has a problem with quality control on the container (and makes one wonder about the chemicals).  Expected better from this brand.  Will definitely pass over the brand name next time.  Also, price seems high.  So much for ordering online.
