This product gets 2 stars for being organic and having no GEI's. However, when I checked out the ingredient list and saw "glucose syrup", I was suspicious. I contacted customer service and asked them what the glucose was derived from. This is the answer that I got:<br /><br />"The glucose syrup is from corn syrup solids.  It is a source of carbohydrates and is included to meet the label's nutrition claim for carbohydrate."<br /><br />Very disappointing, as I really try to keep our diet free from corn syrup and other unhealthy fillers. I don't want my baby to drink this.
