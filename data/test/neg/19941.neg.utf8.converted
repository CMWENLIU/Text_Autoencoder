This soup is nothing more than a slightly thickened mushroom broth. There are no, repeat NO, pieces of mushroom in the soup. The so-called creamy soup is really just a tan-colored, slightly mushroom-flavored, slightly thickened broth. I am not looking forward to eating the other 11 packages in the carton, and I certainly won't order this product again.
