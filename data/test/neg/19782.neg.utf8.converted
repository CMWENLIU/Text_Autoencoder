My cats loved these treats.  I loved these because they are cheaper than the CET brand, and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them.  Why the single star then?  Well, because I can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience.  They just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil, which is toxic to cats.  And it's listed not once, but twice.  I have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure, and there is no way I am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic.  Maybe if I had 2 young cats I would be less concerned, but as it stands, there is no way I will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back.  I still have the packages from the last order I bought, and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula, but I will be buying the CET treats from now on.
