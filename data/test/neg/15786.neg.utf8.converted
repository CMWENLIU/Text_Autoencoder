Let me say that I love Schultz Plant Food.  I have used Schultz All Purpose Plant Food for many years, and this stuff that I just got from Amazon isn't the real stuff.  It's almost clear to light green in color.  The real stuff is dark green.  When I add 7 drops to water, I should see the dispersion of plant food like waves, but this one is so light that I can't see anything.  I am going to return this if I can.
