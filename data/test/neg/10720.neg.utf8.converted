This is my sister's favorite type of cake. As teenagers we would make the Betty Crocker cinnamon swirl cake, which looked just like this one, and she was hoping for something similar.  After she tried to make this mix a couple times without success, she asked me to try.  I will say the overall flavor of this cake is really good, BUT it's very dense.  The crust is thick and hard for a cake and the crumb is very dry.  I tried using Plugra high fat butter, then substituting some of the butter with oil, and I even tried switching pans. I just could not get a moist cake from this mix.
