As a mother of four girls and a bit, (ahem) of a 'germaphobe', it concerned me to crack open these pre-packaged eggs and have loose skittles, loose malted milk eggs and loose Cadbury eggs fall to the floor. These items were not wrapped and nothing in the item description gave me a 'heads up'. As these eggs were intended for a school Easter party, I could not use them. Buyers beware: unwrapped candies and a paltry amount at that. Not worth the expense and certainly not the 'yolk' I was expecting.
