I have a feeling that Coca Cola is paying people to write 5-star reviews on their "new" Zico acquisition. The fact of the matter is that I have been drinking coconut water for over a year now, from Vita Coco, O.N.E., Zico (original), Zico (new Coca Cola disaster) and the bottom line is that the NEW ZICO IS DISGUSTING. It's 1) from concentrate (not pure 100% coconut water), 2) tastes really bad cold and 3) tastes even worse at room temperature.<br /><br />Coca Cola, in typical American corporate greed, took what was the BEST coconut water (Zico original, Mango and Passion Fruit) and absolutely and blatantly destroyed it. They really did. It's absolutely horrid and disgusting and probably not as good for you due to it being from concentrate. Should I mention that it's also more EXPENSIVE than before?<br /><br />Good job Coca Cola, glad to see you have taken over a great product and destroyed it to increase your stock price.<br /><br />O.N.E. is currently the best 100% natural coconut water, in plain flavor. The "new" Zico is just undrinkable. Stay away from it.
