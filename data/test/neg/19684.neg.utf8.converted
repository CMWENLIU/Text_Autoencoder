It kinda tastes like watered down Tabasco mixed with liquid smoke flavoring... That and it also came leaky in the mail.  It was inside a Ziploc bag with the sauce all over the inside... the seal was still on so I tried some anyway but I won't be finishing the bottle.<br /><br />I suggest you save the money and just spice things yourself... It did ship super quick though, which I guess is a plus.
