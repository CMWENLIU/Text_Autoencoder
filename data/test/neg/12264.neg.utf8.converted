I always like my spaghetti sauce to be chunky and thick, this isn't one of them.  I have to added a 2 cans of tomato paste to thicken up and lessen the sweetness of this.  Very litlle mushroom too.  I got this at $7 for 4 jars, so it wasn't too bad.  But I won't be buying these again.  I don't know if company is cutting back on ingredients but buy smaller jars at the grocery store, they may be packed chunkier and more mushroom than these big jars.
