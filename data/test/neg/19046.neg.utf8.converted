I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.  I would've had a clue that I couldn't drink it.  Ingredient labeling should be mandatory.  It certainly wasn't advertised correctly and completely wasted my money.  Buyer beware.
