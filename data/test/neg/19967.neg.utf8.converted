I have had this wonderful treat in Germany but these guys are selling old and stale stuff.  And the shipping was over $20.00<br />I have written to them about it and will update this review if they make good on selling outdated candy.<br /><br />These guys did make goodand ship another order to me but unfortunately they didn't check the product since it too was stale.  Sadly, I feel like I can't change the review.
