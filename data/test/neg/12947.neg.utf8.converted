I've been drinking various varieties of Assam for 10+ years - while I am certainly no tea expert, I know what it is supposed to taste like. The place I've ordered from for the past 10 years went out of business, so I figured I'd try my luck with this one. My first clue that this tea would not be very good should have been the price - 2 lbs for $18 is a steal, Assam is usually twice that. My second should have been the lack of any classification, such as TGFOP (Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe)in the description. I noticed those things, but I ordered it anyway so shame on me. The third clue that I'd made a mistake was when I opened the package - no orange hues, no tips, just a see of blackness in the bag. I've made a pot every day for the past week, thinking maybe the flavor (or lack thereof) would grow on me ... no such luck. It would have been a bargain at $18 if it was at all drinkable, but in my opinion it is not.
