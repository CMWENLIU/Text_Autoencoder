i grew up with the la florentine version. i should have went with that product instead of 'settling' based on price. the nougat is not at all delicate. it is ultra chewy and bordering on hard. not at all soft as is la florentine. the wafer paper is also not delicate, rather it is thick and very noticeable.<br /><br />i did not care for the taste of any. first i ate the orange flavored without looking at the box. it seemed to me to be heavy handed and, i thought, tasted of lemon. i checked the box to see if it were lemon, no. the lemon too was heavy handed. the vanila was borderline ok on not being overwhelming. all were to me, too sweet and too sticky. more like eating taffy than the sensual and delicate la florentine i grew up with.<br /><br />i was disappointed as my wife had never had these before. it was a poor showing of what i had thought they should have been. i had to apologize to her after having raved about the tastes i had on my own. i rapidly canceled my subscription package.
