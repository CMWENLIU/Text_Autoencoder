The new Good Earth original caffeine free tea is half the strength of the old version.  This organic caffeine free tea is half again the strength of the new non-organic version.  If you really like organic stuff, you can buy this and use twice as many tea bags.  I'm buying the non-organic version in the future.  Taste is pretty much the same.
