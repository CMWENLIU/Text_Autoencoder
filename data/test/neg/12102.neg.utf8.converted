I  should have looked more carefully at the types of tea in this awful variety pack.  I just saw the package and assumed it had a variety of fruity tea.  Instead it has mostly icky black tea and green tea.  It has some Lemon Zinger and Sleepytime.  Where is the hybiscus, the orange, berry, and cinnamon on the box?
