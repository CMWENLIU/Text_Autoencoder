I had high hopes for this product. I don't drink coffee a lot, so I was excited to find a K cup that I could enjoy on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this product comes out too diluted even when I use the small cup setting on my machine. It tastes very watery, and is not thick and rich as I had hoped. I will finish the box, but I will not be purchasing this product again.
