When eaten plain, this stuff is absolutely awful, inedible even.  I nearly threw it away. It almost has a bit of a coffee flavor, but in a very bad way, and the aftertaste is even worse.  However, if you eat this on a sandwich with jam, it isn't too bad.  You can tell it isn't real peanut butter, and it doesn't taste good, but it's at least tolerable.  I've been mixing it with reduced fat peanut butter- it's cheaper that way, plus it tastes MUCH better, and I'm still saving on fat and calories.  Overall, I would only recommend this if you have money to spare and you find yourself unable to eat regular peanut butter as moderately as you would like.
