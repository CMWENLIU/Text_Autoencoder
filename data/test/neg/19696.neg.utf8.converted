Let me start by saying I'm not an espresso guy.  I like cream and sugar in my coffee so espresso always seemed to strong to me.  That said, I'm obligated to review this product but it's not for me.  I wound up making coffee out of it by simply filling the cup with more than 2oz.  It's fair coffee, but making plain  coffee in a 150 machine is kind of a waste.
