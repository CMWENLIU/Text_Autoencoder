I hope that one day this snack can reach the point where it is truly healthy and consistently good.<br /><br />A) Claiming to be healthy, at least - last bag I munched on had nutrition info that would in one serving give you the bare minimum healthy cholesterol score (&lt;300) for an entire DAY. Many snacks do this. Like peanuts. Or popcorn. The idea is that since the products are from 'natural' sources, there is less control over the batch. But seriously - less than 300mg per serving? Give me a break. This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control. It's almost like writing a blank check. To yourself. To state that your product's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage. Read the label.<br /><br />B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.<br /><br />I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.<br /><br />A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Just got around to adding this. My wife purchased a bag of the "Hickory Honey BBQ" at the beginning of July. They were real dental-rattlers, uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material. The spices were horribly uneven.<br /><br />Lot mark: 12JUL12 090227921:37
