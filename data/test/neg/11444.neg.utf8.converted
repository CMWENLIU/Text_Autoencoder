I thought I was buying a coffee maker which would be very convient for my mother.  I did not realize how hard it was for her to get the t disks.  Not everyone shops on line, especially at age 76.  She lives in another state, in a rural area and is just too hard for her to find these disks.  Also I have never been able to find Maxwell house disks for her
