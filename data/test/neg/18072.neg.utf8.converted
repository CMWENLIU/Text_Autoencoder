I bought a case of this (Adult Organic Turkey and Organic Vegetables Formula)12.7 oz cans beause my dog adores the Organix Dry Dog Food  and he does very well on it. As soon as I gave him a little canned (a small amount mixed with his other food) he started vomiting white foamy stuff the following morning.  I ended up giving a can to a friend and her dog had horrible breath (from his stomach--does not have bad teeth). I didn't give the rest away, will throw it away. I emailed the company twice and they couldn't  bother to respond in about two weeks. Apparently they don't stand by their products. Now I don't trust any of their products even though my dog does fine on the dry formula.
