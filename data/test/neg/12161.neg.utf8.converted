It's an ok coffee, for a mild blend. But it doesn't really taste like Mudslide at all. My biggest problem is that 9 out of the cups were completely empty!!! So far 4 calls and 4 e-mails to Gloria Jeans hasn't received a reply at all, and I am very frustrated at this. Amazon won't let me initiate a return for the product. Disappointed and I still want a partial refund.
