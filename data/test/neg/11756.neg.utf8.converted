This product tastes like soap. When I called the company to see why, they said it's not food grade. Literally tastes like soap, so it must have been lingering and co-mingling with soap products. The raw tag is misleading - I thought this was edible cocoa butter that you make raw food desserts from. Now I have a pound of chocolate smelling, soap tasting, rock hard chunks to fool with. Very disappointed.
