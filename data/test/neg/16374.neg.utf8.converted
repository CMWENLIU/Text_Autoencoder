When I first saw this in the store I thought it was a great idea and a possible time saver, even at the higher price than other traditional litter boxes. The extra money would be worth the time saving. When I brought it home and started to use it I was disappointed.<br /><br />First, the grate holes in the sifting screen are too large and so much of the smaller clumps fall through you have to scoop anyway. The clumps that fall through are so small that they fall through a regular hand-held scoop as well, I had to find a strainer that would work.  Also, the grate gets easily clogged and you have to clear it out.  The other thing that I find really annoying is that the lid system does not seal well so litter was falling out the back as my cat tossed litter around in the box.  This added a chore that I never had before, cleaning in back of the litter box.<br /><br />All in all I don't think this product has saved me any time or made the job of cleaning out the box any easier.  It actually created more work. I will replace it with a traditional litter box and send this one to the recycling bin.  I really would not recommend it.
