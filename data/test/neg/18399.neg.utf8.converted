I have never tried truffles before so I am not sure how they should smell or taste but I'm afraid there is something very wrong with the truffle salt I purchased from this company. When I opened the container I was hit with a sharp acrid smell that was similar to garlic. It was so strong it filled the entire room within seconds, which sent my family reeling with tears in their eyes. I was determined to try the salt in hopes that the flavor would be better than the smell. I cooked a tiny amount in with scrambled eggs. To my horror the flavor was the same as the smell. I asked some friends to try it and they had the same reaction to the smell and flavor as I did. After all the great things I have heard about truffles I find it hard to believe that this is the way they taste and smell.
