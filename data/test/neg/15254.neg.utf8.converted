This Miracle Noolde Rice is all right, very easy to prepare but really taste like nothing.  I prepare 3 out of 5 bags I purchase, and I prefer the Noodle pasta, that is amazing, the rice has a text of small particules in your mouth, just a weird texture when you are chewing. It was okay, but I will stick to the Shirataki Noodles.
