The description claims this balsamic comes in "jars". I should have examined the picture more closely. This balsamic comes in a plastic squeeze bottle. There are already enough health concerns around plastic containers without adding something so acidic to the mix. Combine this with the heat encountered during shipping and the combo only gets worse.<br /><br />Note that this item is *not* eligible for return either.
