This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.
