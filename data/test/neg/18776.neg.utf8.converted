Used to love this cereal. Low sugar, high protein, and actually tasted pretty good. Sadly, as others have pointed out, the "new improved formula" ruins this cereal. It has changed from 2g of sugar to 7g of sugar without even improving the taste, unless you prefer to eat sugar for breakfast; I do not. Guess I'll have to scour the local stores for the old recipe version and eventually find a new breakfast option. Big letdown Kellogg's.
