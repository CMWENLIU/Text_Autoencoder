When first purchased you could smell the truffle through the container, very strong. Stored it in the jar in a ziplock bag. Thought the "grains" or bits of truffle were not quite right. Texture like soil or clay. Product now smells nothing like truffles, smells like clay, tastes like clay. I believe they used soil that could pass for trufle bits, and infused them with truffle oil. Mixed with the salt it would be hard to tell, but I know I'm not eating salt and truffle. Friends agree. Shameful.
