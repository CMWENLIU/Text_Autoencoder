I love Quinoa, red, white, black Quinoa. We use it in soup, side dishes etc. Now on to this Quinoa flour, its gross, totally gross. We have tried it in various things and the flavor is so bitter and strong that even cutting it with other flours it still over powers everything else. It has the flavor of Quinoa when it hasn't been rinsed properly and has that bitter taste. The texture is odd. Mealy or gummy depending on how you use it. Also the boxes I recieved were going to expire in December! I threw the rest out. Even the bread I baked with it the birds and raccoons wouldn't touch and raccoons with eat about anything! F-
