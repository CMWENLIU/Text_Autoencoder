This is pure marketing scheme...which I fell for because I did not read the description thoroughly enough.  This coffee only has 2% Kopi-Luwak, purely for marketing purposes so they can charge you outrageous price for average coffee.  The coffee itself (brewed in a siphon coffee maker which is renowned for making smooth coffee) has a highly acidic taste and leaves a strong cardboard finish in your mouth. In my opinion, one of the worst cups of coffee I ever tasted.<br /><br />I do highly recommend buying 100% kopi-luwak as it is the smoothest, most organic cup of coffee I've ever tasted.  Not better than Jamaican Blue Mountain, but definitely as good.  Like JBM, Kopi-Luwak has it's own very unique and ultra smooth characteristics. Fantastic but at $70 a pound, it's definitely a weekend coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this coffe.
