Unfortunately I was unable to tolerate this product.  My stomach hurt daily and with each day it got worse.  Stopped taking the Benicol and the stomach pains went away.  I gave this product a try for 2 weeks, by the end of that period I was in a lot of pain that radiated to my back.  I wished I could have tolerated this product.
