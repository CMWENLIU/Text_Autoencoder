This used to be really good tea. For two years we drank it and really liked it.<br /><br />The last two batches have had some kind of sludge that comes off it, so much so that it cloggs the filter on the coffee maker I use to brew it. (The same one I've used for years.)<br /><br />It would be good if we had a way to contact the manufacturer so we could alert them that their good product just went bad, from one month to the next.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Frustrated Green Tea Guy
