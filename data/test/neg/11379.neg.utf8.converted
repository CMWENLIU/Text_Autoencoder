Kellogg's Krave cereal tastes like chemicals to me. It contains ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab by inserting foreign genes into their DNA and made them resistant to massive amounts of RoundUp. The sugar in Krave comes from GMO sugar beet, and the soy is GMO soy. I called Kellogg about a month ago to ask if they are using genetically engineered ingredients and they said they do use them because the FDA says they are safe and Kellogg's complies with the FDA regulations. I called Kellogg's again yesterday (twice) and this time they told me that they don't know if their products contain GMOs because they don't test for them. Kellogg has pumped $632,500 into the propaganda campaign in California that is fighting to trick people not to vote for Prop. 37, for the labeling of genetically engineered foods.  Kellogg's doesn't want you to know that Krave contains GMOs. My family thinks they taste disgusting anyway. Poured the box down the toilet. We won't be eating Krave again. Blech!
