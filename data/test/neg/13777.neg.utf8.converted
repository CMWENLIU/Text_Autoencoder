... these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N5FR3S">Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> were just disappointing. I ordered them in early December to put in candy dishes around the house for holiday goodies. Imagine my surprise when the Reese's that showed up were all Halloween-themed--black and orange wrappers, with no red or green to be seen at all. Worse, the candies had undergone at least one round of melting and resolidifying; they were all warped, stuck to their wrappers in odd ways, with a grainy texture absolutely uncharacteristic of what Reese's should be.<br /><br />Like I said, I love Reese's. But I did not love these. Reese's may be my favorite chocolatey indulgence, but I'll be sourcing them elsewhere in the future.
