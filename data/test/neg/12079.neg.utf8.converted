Matcha is wonderful, but Pier Mall did not send matcha. Instead of .65 lb of matcha powder, I recd .5 lb of Chinese medicinal tea. The label was mostly Chinese and said 'matcha' nowhere. Prepackaged Chinese medicinal tea can be dangerous--it is completely unregulated, and people get sick all the time from bad ingrediants and unforseen reactions. I am asking for my money back and notifying Amazon.
