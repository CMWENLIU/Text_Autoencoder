Disappointed in this drink.  I chose Zevia because I wanted to get away from my diet coke consumption and I love carbonation.  Well, no.  This isn't the answer.<br /><br />First off the taste -<br /><br />I've tried Zevia, Dr. Zevia and the gingerale.  All of them have this artificial sweetness that can't be overriden by the different varieties.  It's nothing like Diet Coke or Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, etc.  I thought I could get used to it but after a couple of weeks, it's just nauseatingly sweet.  The other varieties don't change that.<br /><br />Second, the ingredients -<br /><br />This is the listed ingredient list.  I have a sensitivity to sugar alcohol (zylitor, splenda (sucralose), etc) so I use stevia in my coffee.  No problem.  With this drink, I started having gastrointestinal issues common to sugar alcohols.  I didn't know what was causing it so I changed some things in my diet to no avail.  Then I looked at this ingredient list.  Stevia is NOT the primary sweetener.  Ingredients are listed by the most prevalent first - erythritol is a sugar alcohol.  It's the same chemical family as splenda.  Um.. no thanks.  I wanted a NATURALLY sweetened drink - not another chemical one.<br /><br />I feel this company is being dishonest in its product.  I've discontinued use of this line of beverages while my system settles down from the sugar alcohol and will not be drinking them again.  The taste is inferior and artificial and the ingredients cause me to have problems.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />CARBONATED WATER, **ERYTHRITOL**, CARAMEL COLOR, TARTARIC ACID, REB A (STEVIA EXTRACT), FUMARIC ACID, CAFFEINE, LIME OIL, LEMON OIL, NATURAL FLAVORS, CASSIA OIL, NUTMEG OIL.
