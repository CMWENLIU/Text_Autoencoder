Better'n Peanut Butter is one of the foulest things I have ever eaten. It has a runny, sticky consistency that tries to replicate the real thing, but more effectively replicates a dirty diaper. If you ignore its slightly (oddly) medicinal smell and actually consume this product, you'll wish you hadn't. The taste? Think less peanut butter, more roasted peanut-flavored glue. Low calorie/low fat? Absolutely; especially since I couldn't stand to choke down more than a few bites. In the end, I opted to go without lunch rather than eat my Better'n Peanut Butter sandwich.<br /><br />As a vegetarian who commonly shops at natural food stores/in natural food sections and who is always looking for low calorie foods, I can generally handle "alternative" flavors. I drink rice milk. I eat imitation chicken (soy based). I use whole wheat items whenever possible. So while I was not at all expecting Better'n Peanut Butter to fully live up to it's name, I at least thought it may come close to matching the taste of the real thing (I've eaten the low fat versions of Jif and Skippy peanut butter for years and actually prefer them over their full-fat predecessors). I couldn't have been more wrong.
