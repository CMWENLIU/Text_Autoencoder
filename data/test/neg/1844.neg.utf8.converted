I love their product from Thailand.  I don't like the product from Sri Lanka.<br />The content of coconut oil is higher in Sri Lanka made coco milk, throwing off the consistency.<br />I don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie,<br />it will just chunk up anyway.  Wrote the manufacturer - here's the reply<br /><br />From the manufacturer:<br />Thank you for writing. Due to worldwide surging demand for coconut<br />milk during its lean harvest season, our primary organic packer in<br />Thailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales. Therefore we<br />have added a trusted organic coconut facility in Sri Lanka as our<br />secondary supplier. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka uses a slightly different<br />processing method than Thailand does and the Sri Lankan product has<br />more tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degrees<br />F. This makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separates<br />from the liquid. Such separation is harmless and easily remedied by<br />placing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and then<br />stirring the contents thoroughly. We regret this inconvenience,<br />especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother,<br />creamier consistency of our Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk. While<br />all natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cool<br />temperatures, the Thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous. Faced<br />with lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconut<br />season, we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistencies<br />from two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at all<br />during this six month lean period. We are only shipping Thai sourced<br />coconut milk<br />as of right now, but distributors and stores may still have Sri Lankan<br />sourced product.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and your understanding.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Joanna Freet<br />Edward & Sons Trading Co., Inc.
