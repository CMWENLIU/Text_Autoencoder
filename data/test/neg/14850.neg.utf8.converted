There's so much hype around Acai these days and just about every brand out there exploits Oprah's endorsement. But if you go to Oprah's official site, you'll see the only real endorsement is for the unsweetened pulp. My boyfriend and I have been using the Sambazon frozen pulp and love it. I felt an immediate difference. I didn't get tired at 3pm like I normally do. I was more alert and focused. I felt great. We tried the Navitas powder because it was cheaper. However, it gave me stomach aches and digestive problems. I felt no improvement in energy. I also can't stand the taste - and I'm pretty tolerant of that kind of stuff. My boyfriend hasn't experienced any negative side effects. He says he doesn't mind it. But we both prefer the Sambazon fruit pulp packs instead.
