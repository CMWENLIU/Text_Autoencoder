I love Krinos Taramosalata and we buy it often. So when I saw it at Whole Foods I grabbed a jar. Later, eating it on some French bread something seemed horribly wrong. I looked at the jar and it turned out to be this awful "Lite" version. Tastes nothing like the real thing. Tastes like nothing at all, and there is an unpleasant aftertaste.
