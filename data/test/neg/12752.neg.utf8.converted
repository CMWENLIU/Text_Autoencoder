I have enjoyed this tea for 25 years. Something changed at some point. Recently reading the ingredient list I noticed the second ingredient is "Natural Flavor".  What is it?  I wrote to the company and received a pat answer that it is a 'proprietary blend' and they can not divulge the actual ingredients except to your enquiring physician. It could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe  similar to MSG or it could be worse. Might our bodies think it unnatural?  Do they mean 'natural' as in from planet earth?  So I'll be giving up my favorite tea.<br />I think I am going to get some star anise, cinnamon, rose hips, and cardamom  from Frontier herbs via Amazon instead.
