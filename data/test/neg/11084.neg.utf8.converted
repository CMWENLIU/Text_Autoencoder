I've tried several brands of rum cakes over the years.  There are differences between them, but their usually minor.  This was a totally different experience.  First the presentation is bad.  I thought the can was a novel way of protecting the cake... No, it was cooked in the can and its hard to present it as anything else.  Next the taste and smell were not appealing.  It was a VERY dense cake with fruit overtones.
