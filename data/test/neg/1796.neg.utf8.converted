My family didn't really care for these cookies.  If you haven't previously eaten European cookies, you may no like these.  I have to also admit that after I made the purchase, I started to look at some of the previous reviews and I was appalled at how much calories and fat these cookies have.  Granted, they're cookies for Heaven sakes (not health food), but don't be fooled into thinking that since you may find them a bit bland that they probably have less of the "bad stuff" in them.......Not so!<br /><br />Long and the short, if you've never tried these cookies before, I would strongly recommend that you sample a sleeve (if you can find them) in your grocery store so you don't get stuck with a case that may not be eaten if your family doesn't like them.
