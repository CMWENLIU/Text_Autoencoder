I got the pepper for my mom and she got it REALLY fast.  It came way earlier than expected which was awesome.  However Nothing ever grew!! The nifty pepper-in-a-can was watered according to the directions, carefully and diligently.  However after a month, and still no sprout, my mom dumped everything out looking for a buried plant.  However there was nothing to be found.  Perhaps ours was just a dud.
