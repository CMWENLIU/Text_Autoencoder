I started buying this product in January and it was thick, creamy and delicious.  I needed a hand blender to mix the thick cream with the milk and enjoyed using it to make puddings, etc.  Then, in the Spring the product changed dramatically for the worse.  As previous reviewers stated, they started sourcing the milk from Sri Lanka instead of Thailand and the end product was thin, watery and had little clumps of fat that would not and could not be blended into the milk.  I called the customer service and they advised me to wait before buying more until the can once again said that it was a product of Thailand.  So, a few weeks ago, I was delighted to see that the cans at my local health food store once again stated that they were a "product of Thailand".  However, the product is still not the same product as it was before the change in sourcing.  While it is back to having a creamy like consistency, it is noticeably thinner.  Instead of needing a spoon, it pours right out of the can with the same consistency and thickness of light cream.  I can no longer use it to make puddings, etc because it is too thin.  It's as if someone watered down the product.  I called the company once again and they had absolutely no explanation for this change in thickness.  For a comparison, I also bought a can of the Thai Kitchen brand coconut milk (also sourced from Thailand) and it was exceptionally thick and creamy, about twice the thickness as the Native Forest.  So, until someone can give me a good explanation as to why the new coconut milk is so thin, I will switch to the Thai Kitchen brand.  What a shame, since this used to be a great product.
