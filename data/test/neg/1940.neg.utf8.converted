For years I have been enjoying Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy (natural flavor) tea but the last box had a different flavor, which I don't like. I wasn't aware that it was actually a different formula that has artificial flavor added. The two packages are almost identical in appearance. You have to read the fine print on the lower portion of the front of the package just below where it says "Herbal Tea Blend". One will say Natural and the other (as shown by Amazon here) will say Natural and Artificial Flavor.<br /><br />In talking with a representative at Good Earth, I have been informed that they still make Sweet & Spicy without the artificial flavor. I expressed my concern as to their lack of clear differentiation on packaging. Buyer beware!<br /><br />Update: I have since purchased some of the Natural (no artificial flavor) and found that it too was quite different than I had been used to. Not only was the flavor different but it was very weak compared to the old stuff, which I could easily get two cups out of. The new stuff tasted like it had already been used for two cups before it got to mine.
