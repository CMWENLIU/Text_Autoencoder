This "Level 2" dreck is not even close to the Seattle's Best Breakfast Blend you may have enjoyed in the past. Not dark. Not rich. Mediocre at best. The note on the label is downright deceptive. This "Four Levels" foolishness is one of those cases of fixing something that was not broken. I have sadly been forced to give up on Seattle's Best.
