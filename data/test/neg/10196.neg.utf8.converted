I haven't been able to find Via in any store that sells starbucks coffee (Big chain stores not actual Starbuck stores).  So, to try it, I had to order it through Amazon.  This instant coffee tastes like instant coffee. The only way I would ever use it would be to add it to a weak cup of regular coffee to make a stronger brew.  At least this way the "instant " taste goes away and I can enjoy a strong cup of coffee without my friends having to brew their weak coffee my way. I won't be buying this product. By the way, I ordered the instant Italian Roast. If you like strong coffee like I do, but hate the "instant coffee" taste, don't bother purchasing. I read the favorable reviews and truly hoped I would be just as impressed. Sadly, I was disappointed. Live and learn.
