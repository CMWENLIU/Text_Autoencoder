WEll.. going off of the other reviews where their kids loved them etc...I do not like them and neither do my kids or grandkids so far. Sorry. I'm sure they are healthy, however.. I was disappointed thining they were freeze dried Edemenis or something like that.. not a formed cracker to taste and look like a snow pea ?! sorry, but these 11 bags are going back.. I'd be sending the full 12, however... one bag was opened and then the hubby tossed it after awhile...
