... only I could be assured that it would arrive undamaged. I only gave this product one star because of the packing during shipment. The product itself gets four stars from me. I have used this oil before and I really love it. But I ordered twice and both times I couldn't use the oil because the cans were so severely bent-in. Can't changes be made in how these cans are packed for shipment? Surely they aren't stocked in such horrible condition! The two little air pillows placed on top of the cans did nothing to keep them from banging into each other during shipping. Does anyone listen to the complaints that are posted? Does anyone care? On the chance that someone is listening, please change the way you pack this product for shipment. Pieces of heavy cardboard that can't move placed between the cans might work best. And add some environment friendly 'peanuts' as well as a "FRAGILE" warning. Please continue to give us the products we want in the condition we deserve. Thanks for letting me share my two cents' worth.
