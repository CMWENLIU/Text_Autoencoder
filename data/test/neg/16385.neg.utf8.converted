Do not trust seller "Natural Choice Dog". The item name is "Natural Choice Chicken Meal, Rice, and Oatmeal Formula Dog Food, 30-Pound" but if you look in the details you'll see the size is actually 15 lbs; although the seller is selling it for $35.94 which is an expected 30 lb bag price.<br /><br />Thankfully Amazon will assist with a refund if you get suckered like I did but please be aware this item name is completely misleading. Shame on the seller "Natural Choice Dog" for setting that up.
