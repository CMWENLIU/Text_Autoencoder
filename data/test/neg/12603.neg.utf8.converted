I ordered this - got a package of rotten garlic, so the company sent me a new one, which wasn't rotten, but I think this is poor quality garlic, I had a hard time cutting it up to use in a recipe ( because it was really hard like a rock) and didn't notice much difference between this and regular garlic, I think I'll stick to fresh garlic unless perhaps I try a better quality "black garlic".
