I ordered this product not knowing the location of the fulfillment center from which it would ship.  Turns out it shipped from Sparks, Nevada.  I made the assumption that the person at Amazon.com responsible for warehousing things like chocolate in August would have the common sense to use one of your fulfillment centers where UPS Ground shipments wouldn't be transported in an unrefrigerated truck in 98F weather.  Amazon.com has about 20 different fulfillment centers around the US, yet they choose one on the edge of Death Valley.<br /><br />Pretty genius, folks.
