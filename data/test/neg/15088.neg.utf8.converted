We like a good tasting regular or breakfast blend in our house. Nothing so strong that it leaves you with an upset stomach. Lately, we've been trying a variety of the organic coffees offered on Amazon. Unfortunately, this on was a major disappointment. It's more like strong tea. Our standard measure, with a fine grind, is 6 standard tablespoon sized scoops for a 12 cup drip coffee maker. This coffee was so weak that it didn't even taste like coffee. The second pot, I used 10 scoops, which was a little better, but still had no distinctive coffee aftertaste. If I have to do that, it's a poor value. Our baseline is the Dunkin Donuts regular ground coffee, which smells and tastes like a good cup of Joe. Since coffee cannot be returned, I have to purchase something to mix with this at home, or give it away (I don't know anyone that would want it if I don't like it).
