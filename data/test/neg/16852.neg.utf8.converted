Anyone who does not like to drink chemical solvents, should not drink this Decaf.<br />Even though not denoted on this webpage, when we got the box it clearly stated<br />"Decaffeinated using Methylene Chloride."  This is a chemical solvent which is<br />also used as a paint stripper and degreaser.  Buyer Beware!
