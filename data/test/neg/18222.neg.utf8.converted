I've been using the degree white solid since 1993.  I recently tried the new Degree Solver Ion and found it very irritating.  It caused a lot of redness and took a few layers of skin off.  I will call Unilever forst thing Monday.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXC8E6">Degree for Men Deodorant With Silver Ion Technology, Clean Reaction, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>
