We just made our first loaf in our 2 lb breadmaker (which usually produces awesome loaves of bread).  The bread never rose.  It turned out to be a very dense, 1/2 sized loaf with a horrible texture on top.  After reading our breadmaker trouble-shooting suggestions, I have to wonder if the yeast was old or the flour was old.  We'll try it again (since we still have 3 bags) but so far we are completely disappointed.
