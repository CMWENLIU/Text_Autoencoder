Perhaps it was just my microwave, or cooking it too long, but the two different types of this soup I have tried (Chicken with noodles, and chicken with rice) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of.<br /><br />I would have thrown it out, except it was the only thing I brought for lunch.  I do NOT recommend this soup!
