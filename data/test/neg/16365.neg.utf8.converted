When I started drinking Sparkling Ice, I was really excited, I told all my friends about this new found jewel. Well my excitement was short lived. This drink, sparkles all over the place...uhhh. What i'm saying is that it is so carbonated that you have to make sure you open the same bottle with caution everytime you want to drink it, otherwise it will explode all over your clothes, books etc, which I experienced. I was so mad I thought I may like the taste but lm not going to be on the edge each time I want to open a bottle I have already been drinking from. Its like you cannot afford to be distracted if you want to drink Sparkling Ice that's for sure....
