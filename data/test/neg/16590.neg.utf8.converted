What I am saying is that if I gave you a spoon of this stuff and said "Friend, taste my homemade chocolate frosting," you would say "Oh my, that is a tasty chocolate frosting, but it's a bit thick."<br /><br />They say "no sugar added!" with pride, but note "evaporated cane juice" is the second most prominent ingredient.  It's just thick frosting.
