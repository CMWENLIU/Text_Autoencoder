First shipment on my subscription was of excellent quality - crunchy and rightly seasoned. The next 2 shipments were terrible - nuts had the texture of soft cocktail peanuts and the jar had an abundance of salt, nut bits and hulls. This was not an oversight by Planter's because all jars on both shipments were loaded with junk. Good-bye Planter's!
