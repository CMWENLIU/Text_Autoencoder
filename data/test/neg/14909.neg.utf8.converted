I have been drinking coconut water for several years and have tried almost every brand. I finally found the best one - by a long shot: Taste Nirvana brand. Still, when I saw CoCo Libre Organic coconut water on sale at a local store, I immediately purchased one to compare it. If I hadn't been so thirsty, I would have tossed it after the first swallow. It's the latest in a series of "natural" coconut waters that are anything but. It tastes cooked, tastes like it has additives in it (it's from concentrate) and it tastes flat and slightly plasticky. It's really unappealing to me. The fact that  you can reseal the bottle is nice, but no reason to subject yourself to an inferior product. Taste Nirvana is incrediblly light and fresh; it seems like my cells just absorb it instantly. There is no aftertaste and the product is fantastic from batch to batch. I like the size in the cans, but Taste Nirvana also comes in resealable bottles that are the same size as Coco Libre. Do yourself a favor and buy Taste Nirvana instead. No, I am not affiliated in any way with the company, but I do really respect and support products that are clean, as close to truly natural as possible, and delicious. Coco Libre is not.
