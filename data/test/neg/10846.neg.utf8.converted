I thought I was doing my dogs good - paying what, $8 or $9 for one bag at the pet store. Then it was brought to my attention in a review here on amazon that this product is "made in China." Probably takes the slave labor there a month to earn that much. Will never buy this product again. Buy Healthy Happy Pet, Snook's instead.
