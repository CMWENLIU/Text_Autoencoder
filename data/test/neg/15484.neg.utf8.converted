I was disgusted by this "hot chocolate". You MUST use it with milk - using water is by far the most disgusting thing I have ever tried to drink. Even with the warm milk - you need several extra scoops of this to make it taste even okay. It was a TOTAL waste of money. I dontaed the other 3 cans to the food pantry.<br />There is no flavor to it - just makes the milk kind of greasy until you add about 5 or 6 scoops - then you get at least a chocolate flavor. Being that I LOVE Ghirardelli chocolate bars I expected soemthing MUCH better than this garbage.
