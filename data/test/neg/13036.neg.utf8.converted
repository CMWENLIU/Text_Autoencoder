Totally agree that the new packaging is a pain in the neck.  I switched to Enfamil after the Similac recall, and I have half a mind now to return to Similac because of the annoyance of the Enfamil container (plus Enfamil is more expensive!).  I'm sure the formula itself is good stuff (hence the 2 stars), but you wind up losing a fair bit every time you empty the stupid bag into the plastic bin. -- It's POWDER, after all, so it practically clouds up and is messy.  And the hinged top of the plastic bin is loose, and the scoop isn't as secure as the Similac device, etc., etc.  HATE it.  And the whole notion of buying refill bags is a racket because they're hard to find and represent NO savings.  What were the Johnson Mead people thinking?!?  I wish they had just copied the Similac design.  Or better yet, I wish the Abbott people hadn't screwed up with the need to recall . . .
