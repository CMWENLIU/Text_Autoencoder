Oh this just makes me so mad I could spit.  Yes, it is my fault for not looking at the size of the can instead of just assuming it was the larger can based on the photo.  I had been scouring the internet for a good price and was so tired by the time I made this purchase, I was foggy.  NOT A GOOD PRICE FOR THE SIZE.  DECEPTION IN ADVERTISING. SHAME ON AMAZON!
