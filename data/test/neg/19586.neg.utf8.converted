Be sure to read the ingredients carefully before selecting this product for its health benefits. This company touts the benefits of quinoa (super food) without mentioning that this product is also made with corn (not so super.) It also doesn't bother to share what percentage of the flour used is quinoa compared to corn, but since corn is the first ingredient and the pasta is bright yellow... well you get the picture.
