This tea is horrible...it smells and tastes as if it contains some kind of chemical.  Their website lists these ingredients:  organic Rooibos, blended with...Mediterranean carob and the zest of ginger and cinnamon bark. Chicory and licorice root...it does not mention the "shortbread flavouring"  (what the heck is that?) or "chocolate flavouring" that are on the ingredients list on the actual tin of tea.  Try the Rishi chocolate chai instead - it is smooth and heavenly.
