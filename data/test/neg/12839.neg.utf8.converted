<span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>COUSCOUS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GRAINS,SINCE ITS EASY TO DIGEST,DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO COOK,& ITS VERY DELICIOUS.<br /><br />THIS COUSCOUS TASTES GREAT...........WHEN IT COMES IN A BAG THAT ISN'T DEFECTIVE & RIDDLED WITH HOLES,TAPE & DUST ALL OVER IT.<br /><br />THIS BAG LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TOSSED AROUND IN THE DESERT BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO SHIP IT TO ME.<br /><br />2ND TIME THAT I ORDERED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON WAS JUNE 30TH.......... IT CAME TO ME ON JULY 3RD.<br /><br />WELL,WHEN I OPENED THE BOX,I FOUND COUSCOUS ALL OVER THE INSIDE..........& LIKE 30 PIECES OF TAPE COVERING THE FRONT OF THE BAG!<br /><br />I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT AMAZON WOULD SEND THIS OUT TO ME.............BUT I GUESS THEY DIDN'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH.<br /><br />IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY THIS,THEN PLEASE CHECK THE BAG............SO THAT YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED LIKE ME.<br /><br />JUST SO YOU KNOW,I'VE ORDERED THIS ITEM BEFORE FROM AMAZON WITH NO PROBLEMS,SO I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL DO IT AGAIN.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YR7A78">Osem North African Couscous, 10 Pound Bag</a>
