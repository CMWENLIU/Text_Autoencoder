After reading the reviews, I thought this was the perfect product to make my 1year old son his birthday cake since he has a life-threatening allergy to eggs. I made cake 5 times and each one just fell apart - literally. Tasted great, but certainly wasn't a "cake" I could ice. I finally googled eggless cakes and made one with orange juice that held perfectly. Would not recommend this to anyone.
