I tried a couple of the Sukhi's spice mix packets. They had good flavor but are way over-priced for the amount of spice you get. The Gobi Aloo mix had 0.4 oz of spice which was barely enough to flavor the 2 cups of vegetables called for which is supposed to be 4 servings. One half cup of vegetables for a serving is pretty small in my opinion. If there was a decent amount of spice in the packet I would rate it higher. I got it on sale at $2 a packet and even at that price it felt like a rip-off.
