Just received my 5lb package of licorice allsorts. It looked like it had been in a shop window for years. The candy was hard and it was discolored. This was not what I expected from Amazon. I have had excellent results from Amazon, but that was with books, perhaps things are not that great in the groceries department.  I will not order from Cherryfield Candy Inc.ever again.I was extremely disappointed with the product. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AO9LA">Licorice Allsorts [5LB Bag</a>]
