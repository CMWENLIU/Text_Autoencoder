I have tried several brands/types of hemp protein powders and this is definitely the worst overall that I have experienced. The actual flavor of the powder is fine and has the expected seedy/chalky taste; however, this powder is more coarse than many others and is almost the size of fine sand pieces. Therefore the powder is unable to dissolve at all in any liquid you mix it with.<br /><br />I also felt strong stomach pains when drinking this product. No hemp proteins have caused this problem before so I think it is due to this product's poor quality. After this experience I plan on sticking with the "Manitoba Harvest Hemp Pro 70 Concentrated" powder as I have loved this product and had no digestive problems with it.
