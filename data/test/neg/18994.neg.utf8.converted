I buy and use coconut oil often.  I use it to cook with, spread on various foods, take it for my health, use on my skin and hair; kind of a coconut oil junkie.  I bought this to try thinking it was better bang for my buck.  It works well on my skin and hair but in my humble opinion the taste is terrible.  I much prefer the taste of Coconut Pacific 100% Pure Organic Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil.  I hope Coconut Pacific's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DHM8S">Coconut Oil Extra Virgin Organic 14 Oz - Noni Pacific</a> will come back into stock soon as I mainly use Coconut Oil and Olive Oil for day to day cooking.<br /><br />So, if you are seeking coconut oil for your health where you eat up to a tablespoon a day - do not buy this as you will never get it down.<br /><br />If you are only looking to use on your hair and skin this should be okay.
