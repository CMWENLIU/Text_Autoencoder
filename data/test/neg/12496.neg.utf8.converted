What a disapointment. I should have taken heed to the negative review saying it was a cheaply covered veneer box. It does NOT look like wood. There is a horrible smell when I opened the box. Unfortunatly being a food product it is not eligible for return.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item for a gift or for a nice display of tea. I'm hoping that the tea is worth the cost of the entire item. . .
