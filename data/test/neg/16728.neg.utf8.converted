I love mocha, cappuccino, coffee, chocolate and everything that I think went into making these cookies - but was dissatisfied with these cookies.  They were dry and just a bit chalky - that's the best word I can think of to describe the texture and mouthfeel.  If you want to try Erin Baker's breakfast cookies, go for the Chocolate Chunk, Double Chocolate, or Oatmeal Raisin (or the peanut butter minis!).
