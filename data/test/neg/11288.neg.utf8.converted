We love these truffles. I just received them after waiting many weeks. When they arrived they were all, and I mean all were melted. They were put in a box with popcorn around them. I was very disappointed with the way they shipped them. I think they should be shipped with some ice packs to protect them from melting. I will not order from these people ever again. Hugh mistake in packaging!!!
