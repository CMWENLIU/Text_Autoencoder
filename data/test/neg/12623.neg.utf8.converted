I grew up in Philly and NY and traveled extensively. Dined in so many excellent Chinese restaurants in every major U.S.city. I love really Hot Chinese mustard and ordered this product. It is awful. The worst! Thick paste NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING MILDLY HOT. Gulden's brown mustard is better. Save your money. THIS IS REALLY AWFUL. You will throw it out along with your money! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. The only thing authentic about this product is the label.
