I've been using this brand for a long time and loved it always. But two of them I ordered came yesterday( Batch # 000013 )tasted terribly wrong. They are not the same taste as I previously ordered. I tasted they are contaminated, and I almost threw up, after one spoonful bite. I hope this informs other regular customers as well, so this company actually investige to see what is going on with their own product. I really miss their previous honey.
