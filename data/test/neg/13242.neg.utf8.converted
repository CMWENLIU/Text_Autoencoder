Boy, Nestle chocolate is not at all as it used to be. I used to love it. You can't find it in a store and now I know why, it's awful! I hadn't seen it for so long then saw it on-line. I ate a few, the last one I couldn't even finish it was so awful to me. I gave my friend the box, told her maybe you will like it.
