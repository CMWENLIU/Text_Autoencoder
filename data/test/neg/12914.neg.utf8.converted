I had an enormous hope for this "patent-pending" technology and was shocked to find that this product doesn't taste like anything. I thought is was just me and tested it on several genetically different individuals. Everybody had the same perception. Several companies distribute this product under different labels.<br /><br />I found a small maker who takes custom orders, and she made incredible chocolate sweetened only with xylitol! Again, tested on several people. E-mail her: cocosrawchocolates at yahoo.
