NICE COFFEE, BUT....<br /><br />i like Gloria Jean coffee.  great flavor, not bitter at all.  some people think they are not strong enough, but i think they're perfect.  way better than the bitter stuff you get at starbucks!<br /><br />i ordered this through a promotion and combined it with a subscription and saved a ton of money (paid less than $15 for the box).  just got the package yesterday and i do like the packaging... but because it didn't look like the factory packaging that i usually get, i decided to count the number of k-cups.  THERE WERE ONLY 49!!<br /><br />i called and left a message with DIEDRICH (the name and number were on the box) but i haven't heard from them yet.<br /><br />if they shorted every customer 1 k-cup (yes, i know it's not much, but it's really the principle!), think of how much they'd be saving!  and just how many customers would actually go and count their k-cups before starting to use them?  i normally don't.<br /><br />anyway, i recommend the coffee, but i also recommend you counting them upon receipt.
