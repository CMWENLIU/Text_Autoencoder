This is ridiculously expensive for raman. Even at the high-end, over-priced grocery store by my home, these little noodle packs sell for 20 cents a pop, and I find THAT to be too much. Amazon is trying to sell these at 58 cents a pack. I think not. Sure it's just pennies. But if I'm going to spend 20 some dollars, I still want to buy as much as a possibly can. So, really don't buy this. If you really don't care about the cost, save the money and donate what's left to a worth-while cause.
