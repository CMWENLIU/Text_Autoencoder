I don't do very many reviews of products, but I had to for this to try and spare others like me. This is one of the most repulsive, vile and sickening "food" products I have ever had. I know nothing about their other flavors, but stay very far away from this. It tastes like someone took whiteboard chalk, ground it up, put it into a kiln with coffee bean shells and "roasted" them together until they were burned beyond recognition. I can't find the words to describe the awfulness of this product. So I'll try a different method to describe it... Some of you may be looking at these bars because they are vegan. If you are, trust me, you will be happier eating a slab of baby seal which you clubbed yourself while kicking puppies in the face. I truly wish there was a negative star rating. This product deserves it.
