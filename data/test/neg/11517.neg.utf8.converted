I just ate half of a 4.25 ounce Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds Bar and found ZERO, ZIP, -0- WHOLE ALMONDS.  In fact, I found nothing close to an entire almond...the biggest was maybe a third of one half of a single nut! REALLY?! That is nuts!  I am sick of companies cheaping out on consumers.  For my entire 58 yr. life, my favorite chocolate, without exception, and including the likes of other crowd favorites like Godiva, has been Hershey's.  But this cost-cutting stuff by Hershey's?  How can this be true?  Okay, maybe it's acceptable to put "pieces" (taste like stale floor sweepings) into Halloween-sized very small bars, but, please, NOT into the larger candy bars that earned Hershey's such a great brand name!  Keep it up and you will lose customers like me who know quality from crap.  Charge more but don't listen to the corporate idiots telling you it's okay to sub almond pieces for almonds.  Please chime in if you know what I am talking about!
