I used 2 - 1 gallon containers of this stuff around my 4 unit property. Where the weeds grow up between the pavers. On a few places on the boarder of my flower beds. The temp was over 60 in fact it was 75. I'm in southern CA. Took a look a week later and the weeds I poured liberal amounts of this product,... are not even wilted!
