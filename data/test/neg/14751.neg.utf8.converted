I received this tea box as a gift from a coworker.  I'm a big tea drinker and I've tried many brands and varieties of tea.  The tea tasted weak and stale to me.  The wrappers are a thin paper, and that might be a contributing factor to the decline in taste.  I tried every flavor once and now the box just sits in my cabinet.  I feel that Bigelow's tea is far superior to Bentley's and would avoid drinking Bentley's in the future.
