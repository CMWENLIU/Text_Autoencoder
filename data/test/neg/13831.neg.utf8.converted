The jars were poorly packaged.  Although the 3 jars were packed in bubble wrap there was nothing between each jar.  The jars worked themselves open during shipping and one was even smashed to bits.  One package arrived leaking and with mold inside so it was likely damaged before it was shipped.<br /><br />Amazon remedied the situation to my satisfaction and I love the convenience of ordering products from them.  I just wish the supplier would pack the items better.  This is the only problem I have experienced and I order tons of stuff.
