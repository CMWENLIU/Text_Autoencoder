I saw "Japonica rice" and made the mistake of thinking these were made in Japan.  Realized they are actually made in China.  I avoid buying anything made in China, if possible, because of the political ramifications, but particularly avoid buying products for my infant made in China because of the safety issues.<br /><br />My daughter did enjoy these, but I won't be buying them again.
