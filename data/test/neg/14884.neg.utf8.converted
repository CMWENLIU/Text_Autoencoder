Dear Amazon,<br />this purchase was a bait and switch item. the Ludens Original Menthol Cough drops were switched to Ludens Cool Menthol. different ingredients, different taste. They sent me a return label. I returned the product.They never credited my Amex acct. I am very disappointed as I reported this to amazon and no action was taken by amazon. Terry Fink
