How do I know?  Because my son choked on a piece that had broken off (and he hadn't cut a single tooth yet when this happened). I tried them again thinking that maybe just that one biscuit was "defective" but biscuit after biscuit continued to break.  Now I'm stuck with a case of these biscuits because it's the only way that Amazon sells them.  I may continue to give them to my son seeing as he seems to like the way they taste but will do so only when I have the time to sit down and watch him even more carefully than I usually do when he's feeding himself.
