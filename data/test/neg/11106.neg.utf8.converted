This tea is just dust. I opened a bag and started coughing. It looked like someone just swept the floor and put it into a bag.<br />I decided that may be (just may be) I do not understand something and tried it anyway. Who knows the looks could be deceiving. I did not like the taste. It was not as disgusting as the look of the tea, but not good.<br />There is no point of returning it. I will just throw away the whole bag.
