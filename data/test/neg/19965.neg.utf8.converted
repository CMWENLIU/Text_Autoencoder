What you really have here is, too much money and a need to, throw some of it away to pay this price... Give me a break - $25.00 for 1 lbs. of Wis. Cheddar cheese.? I am not saying anything at all against Wisconsin Cheese, it's great stuff! Just not worth $25.00 a pound no matter where it's made or comes from...
