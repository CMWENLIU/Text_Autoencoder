Sure wish I had researched cacao before purchasing $50 worth of nibs and powder.  For some reason I expected the nibs to be like chocolate chips without the sweetness.  It's like eating wood chips or something.  The powder is delicious, but I am now reading article after article about the negative effects of raw cacao stemming from the theobromine, caffeine, etc.  It's a powerful stimulant, not unlike a drug.  After spending the last few months cleansing, losing 25 pounds and switching to a mostly raw food diet, I feel like I've backslid into my old addictions to chocolate and caffeine.  Warning to others before you spend your hard-earned cash!
