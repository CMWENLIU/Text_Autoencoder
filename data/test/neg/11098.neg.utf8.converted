This extract doesn't smell like roses at all.  It has a very herbal smell, something like lavender but not as pleasant.  I'm very disappointed.  Small bottles of rose essence I bought at an Indian grocery smell much more like roses than this product does.  I don't know if there's a chance that the bottle was mislabeled and really is some other extract, but I won't be able to use this product to flavor things with a rose flavor.  I'll have to stick with rose water and the rose essence I bought at the Indian market.
