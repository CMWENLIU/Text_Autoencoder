I'm traditionally a big fan of Yogi teas, but this one was an unpleasant surprise. It tastes like it smells, a bit like a cup of hot chocolate that's gone off and has begun to sprout mold. I managed two cups, hoping I'd get used to the taste, but in the end, I had to pitch the lot as it made my entire cupboard stink. Looking at the ingredients list, I think carob, chocolate's oft lackluster understudy, is to blame.
