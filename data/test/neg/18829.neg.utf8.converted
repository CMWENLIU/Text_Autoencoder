The diet rootbeer is not as good as the other diet flavors, such as diet grapefruit, which had a nice flavor. Diet rootbeer is bitter. The flavor is also weak, compared to the other diet flavors. If you add more to get the full flavor, the bitterness of the after taste is horrible. I would not recommend this flavor to anyone, so very disappointing.
