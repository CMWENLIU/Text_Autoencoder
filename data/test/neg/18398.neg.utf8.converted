I was disappointed with the product for two reasons the saltiness doesn't come thru the way it should and the Truffle flavor comes off as artificial in smell and taste. I will not buy again, I would rather make the 60 mile drive to buy the brand I purchased the first time that made me fall in love with Truffle Salt.
