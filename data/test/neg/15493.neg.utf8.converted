I would LOVE to have the above item. Actually really wanted it so much that I called about it twice. BOTH times i was sent 6 oz. PACKAGES of pecans that I could have (but probably would not have) bought in any store. My husband is extremely fond of the CANNED pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line. I don't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others. Sorry but i'll have to really research the product before i order again.<br /><br />Ms. Judie Cardwell
